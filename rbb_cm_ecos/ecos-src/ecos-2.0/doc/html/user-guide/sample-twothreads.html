>When running in a simulator the 
delays might be quite long. On a hardware board (where the clock
speed is 100 ticks/second) the delays should average to
about 2.25 seconds. In simulation, the delay will depend on the
speed of the host processor and will almost always be much slower than
the actual board. You might want to reduce the delay parameter when running
in simulation.</P

>Figure 13-1</A

multitasking program executes.  Note that apart from the thread
creation system calls, this program also creates and uses a
<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>mutex</I
></SPAN
> for synchronization
between the <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>printf()</TT
> calls in the two
threads. This is because the C library standard I/O (by default) is
configured not to be thread-safe, which means that if more than one
thread is using standard I/O they might corrupt each other. This is
fixed by a mutual exclusion (or <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>mutex</I
></SPAN
>) lockout
mechanism: the threads do not call <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"

<TT

>cyg_mutex_lock()</TT

when the other thread calls
