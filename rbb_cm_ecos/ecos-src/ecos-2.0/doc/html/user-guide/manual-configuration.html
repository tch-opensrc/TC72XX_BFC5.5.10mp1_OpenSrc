>eCos</SPAN
> system and building
      the target library. However, some user prefer to use command
      line tools. These command line tools can also be used for batch
      operations on all platforms, for example as part of a nightly
      rebuild and testing procedure.
    </P
><P
>In the current release of the system the command line tools
      do not provide exactly the same functionality as the graphical
      tool. Most importantly, there is no facility to resolve
      configuration conflicts interactively.</P
><P
>The <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> configuration system, both graphical and command
      line tools, are under constant development and enhancement.
      Developers should note that the procedures described may change
      considerably in future releases. </P

><P
>When building <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> there are three main directory trees to
	consider: the source tree, the build tree, and the install
	tree.</P
><P
>The source tree, also known as the component repository,
	  is read-only. It is possible to use a single component
	  repository for any number of different configurations, and
	  it is also possible to share a component repository between
	  multiple users by putting it on a network drive.</P
><P
>The build tree contains everything that is specific to a
	  particular configuration, including header and other files
	  that contain configuration data, and the object files that
	  result from compiling the system sources for this
	  configuration. </P
><P
>The install tree is usually located in the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>install</TT
> subdirectory
of the build tree. Once an <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> system has been built, the install
tree contains all the files needed for application development including
the header files and the target library. By making copies of the
install tree after a build it is possible to separate application
development and system configuration, which may be desirable for
some organizations. </P
