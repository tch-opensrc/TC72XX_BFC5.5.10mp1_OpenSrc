>If a program wanted to execute a task at a given time, or
periodically, it could do it in an inefficient way by sitting in a
loop and checking the real-time clock to see if the proper amount of
time has elapsed. But operating systems usually provide system calls
which allow the program to be informed at the desired time.</P

precise definition, relationship, and motivation of these features is
beyond the scope of this tutorial, but these examples illustrate how
to set up basic periodic tasks.</P

>Alarms are events that happen at
a given time, either once or periodically. A thread associates an
alarm handling function with the alarm, so that the function will
be invoked every time the alarm &#8220;goes off&#8221;.</P

>When running in a simulator the  delays
might be quite long. On a hardware board (where the clock speed is 100
ticks/second) the delays should average to about 0.3 seconds (and 2
seconds between alarms). In simulation, the delay will depend on the
speed of the host processor and will almost always be much slower than
the actual board. You might want to reduce the delay parameter when
running in simulation.</P

><P
>It used the <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_real_time_clock()</TT
> function;
this always returns a handle to the default system real-time  clock. </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Clocks are based on  counters, so the function <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_alarm_create()</TT
>
uses a counter handle. The program used the function
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_clock_to_counter()</TT
> to strip the clock handle
to the underlying counter handle. </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Once the alarm is created it is 
initialized with <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_alarm_initialize()</TT
>, which
sets the time at which the alarm should go off, as well as the period
for repeating alarms. It is set to go off at the current time and
then to repeat every 200 ticks. </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The alarm handler function
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>test_alarm_func()</TT
> conforms to the guidelines for
writing alarm handlers and other  delayed service routines: it does not invoke any
functions which might lock the scheduler.  This is discussed in detail
in the <I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
><SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> Reference Manual</I
>, in the chapter
<I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>The <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> Kernel</I
>.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>There is a <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>critical region</I
></SPAN
> in this program:
the variable <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>how_many_alarms</TT
> is accessed in the
main thread of control and is also modified in the alarm handler. To
prevent a possible (though unlikely) race condition on this variable,
access to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>how_many_alarms</TT
> in the principal thread
is protected by calls to <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_scheduler_lock()</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_scheduler_unlock()</TT
>. When the scheduler is
locked, the alarm handler will not be invoked, so the problem is
averted. </P
