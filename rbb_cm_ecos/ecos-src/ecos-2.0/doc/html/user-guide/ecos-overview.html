NAME="ECOS-OVERVIEW">Chapter 2. <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> Overview</H1
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> is an open source, configurable,
	portable, and royalty-free embedded real-time operating
	system. The following text expands on these core aspects that
	define <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
>.</P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> is provided as an open source
	runtime system supported by the GNU open source development
	tools. Developers have full and unfettered access to all
	aspects of the runtime system. No parts of it are proprietary
	or hidden, and you are at liberty to examine, add to, and
	modify the code as you deem necessary. These rights are
	granted to you and protected by the GNU Public License (GPL).
	An exception clause has been added to the eCos license which
	limits the circumstances in which the license applies to other
	code when used in conjunction with eCos. This exception grants
	you the right to freely develop and distribute applications
	based on <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
>. You are not expected
	or required to make your embedded applications or any
	additional components that you develop freely available so
	long as they are not derived from
	<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> code. We of course welcome all
	contributions back to <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> such as
	board ports, device drivers and other components, as this
	helps the growth and development of
	<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
>, and is of benefit to the
	entire <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> community. See <A
HREF="ecos-licensing.html"
>Chapter 3</A
> for more details.</P
><P
>One of the key technological innovations in
	<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> is the configuration
	system. The configuration system allows the application writer
	to impose their requirements on the run-time components, both
	in terms of their functionality and implementation, whereas
	traditionally the operating system has constrained the
	application's own implementation. Essentially, this enables
	<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> developers to create their own
	application-specific operating system and makes
	<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> suitable for a wide range of
	embedded uses. Configuration also ensures that the resource
	footprint of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> is minimized as
	all unnecessary functionality and features are removed. The
	configuration system also presents
	<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> as a component
	architecture. This provides a standardized mechanism for
	component suppliers to extend the functionality of
	<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> and allows applications to be
	built from a wide set of optional configurable run-time
	components. Components can be provided from a variety of
	sources including: the standard
	<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> release; commercial third
	party developers or open source contributors.</P
><P
>The royalty-free nature of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> means that you can develop and
deploy your application using the standard <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> release without
incurring any royalty charges. In addition, there are no up-front
license charges for the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> runtime source code and associated
tools. We provide, without charge, everything necessary for basic
embedded applications development.</P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> is designed to be portable to a
wide range of target architectures and target platforms including 16,
32, and 64 bit architectures, MPUs, MCUs and DSPs. The
<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> kernel, libraries and runtime
components are layered on the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), and
thus will run on any target once the HAL and relevant device drivers
have been ported to the target's processor architecture and
board. Currently <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> supports a large
range of different target architectures:

><P
><SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> has been designed to support
applications with real-time requirements, providing features such as
full preemptability, minimal interrupt latencies, and all the
necessary synchronization primitives, scheduling policies, and
interrupt handling mechanisms needed for these type of
applications. <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> also provides all the
functionality required for general embedded application support
including device drivers, memory management, exception handling, C,
math libraries, etc. In addition to runtime support, the
<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> system includes all the tools
necessary to develop embedded applications, including
<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> software configuration and build
tools, and GNU based compilers, assemblers, linkers, debuggers, and
simulators.</P
><P
>To get the most out of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN

should visit the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> open source
developers site: <A
HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/ecos/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://sources.redhat.com/ecos/</A
>.</P
><P
>The site is dedicated to the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
>
      developer community and contains a rich set of resources
      including news, FAQ, online documentation, installation guide,
      discussion and announcement mailing lists, and runtime and
      development tools downloads. The site also supports anonymous
      CVS and WEBCVS access to provide direct access to the latest
      <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> source base. </P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> is released as open source
      software because we believe that this is the most effective
      software development model, and that it provides the greatest
      benefit to the embedded developer community as a whole. As part
      of this endeavor, we seek the input and participation of
      <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> developers in its continuing
      evolution. Participation can take many forms including:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>providing us with feedback on how <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> might be made more
useful to you - by taking part in the ongoing mailing list discussions
and by submitting problem reports covering bugs, documentation issues,
and missing features</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>contributing bug fixes and enhancement patches</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>contributing new code including device drivers, board
ports, libraries, and other runtime components</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>Our long term aim is to make <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> a
rich and ubiquitous standard infrastructure for the development of
deeply embedded applications.  This will be achieved with the
assistance of the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> developer community
cooperating to improve <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> for all. We
would like to take this opportunity to extend our thanks to the many
<SPAN

contributed feedback, ideas, patches, and code that have augmented and
improved this release.</P
