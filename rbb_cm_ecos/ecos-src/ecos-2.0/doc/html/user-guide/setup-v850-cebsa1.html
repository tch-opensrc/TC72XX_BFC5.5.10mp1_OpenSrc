><P
>Run the v850-elf-gdb client to debug the V850 target.  It
is necessary to issue certain configuration commands to the I.C.E.
software.  These commands may be issued directly in the MDI window
or they may be issued from the gdb client through the "monitor"
command.</P
><P
>On the Cosmo CEB-V850 board, on-chip Flash is mapped at address
0x0, the on-board EPROM at 0x100000 and the on-board RAM at 0xfc0000.
Since a stand alone V850 will start executing from address 0x0 on
reset, it is normal to load either an application or a bootstrap
loader for Flash at this address. eCos programs may be built to
boot from Flash or the on-board EPROM. If building for the on-board
EPROM, it would be expected that the Flash will contain the default
CEB-V850 flash contents. An ELF format version of the default contents
may be found in the eCos distribution with the name v850flash.img.</P
><P
>In stand alone operation, normally the code in this flash image
would have been programmed into the V850 on the Cosmo board, and
this would cause it to vector into the on-board EPROM to run the
application located there. In the case of eCos, this application
may be a GDB stub ROM application, allowing the further download
to RAM over serial of actual applications to debug.</P
><P
>As an example, we shall demonstrate how to use the I.C.E.
to download the v850flash.img and GDB stub EPROM image using I.C.E.
emulator memory only, and not requiring any actual programming of
devices.</P

><P
>NOTE: The four "monitor step" commands are only required the
first time the board is connected to the I.C.E., otherwise the program
will fail.</P
><P
>This is because of a limitation of the I.C.E. hardware that
means that the first time it is used, the "map" commands are not
acted on and the addresses "0x100000" and "0xfc0000" are not mapped.
This can be observed using the command "td e-20" in the MDI application&quot;s
console to display the trace buffer, which will show that the contents
of address 0x100000 are not valid. Subsequent runs do not require
the "monitor step" commands.</P
><P
>It is unusual to load two executable images to a target through
gdb.  From the example above notice that this is accomplished by
attaching to the libremote server, loading the flash image, detaching,
reattaching, and loading the ROM/RAM image. It is more
normal to build an executable image that can be executed directly.
In eCos this is achieved by selecting either the ROM or ROMRAM startup
type, and optionally enable building for the internal FLASH. The
I.C.E. emulator memory can emulate both the internal FLASH and the
EPROM, so real hardware programming is not required.</P
><P
>Upon running this example you will notice that the libremote
server does not exit upon detecting a detach request, but simply
begins listening for the next attach request.  To cause v850ice
to terminate, issue the "monitor quit" or "monitor exit" command
from the gdb client.  v850ice will then terminate with the next
detach request.  (You can also enter control-c in the Cygwin/DOS
window where v850ice is running.)</P

>If a filename is referenced in an MDI command, whether the
command is entered in the MDI window or issued from the gdb client
with the monitor command, the file must reside on the Windows NT
libremote server system.  When specifying a filename when entering
a command in the MDI window it is obvious that a server local file
is being referenced.  When issuing an MDI command from the gdb client, the
user must remember that the command line is simply passed to the
I.C.E. software on the server system.  The command is executed by
the I.C.E. software as though it were entered locally.</P
><P
>Executable images may be loaded into the V850 target by entering
the "load" command in the MDI window or with the gdb "load" command.
 If the MDI load command is used, the executable image must be located
on the server system and must be in S Record format.  If the gdb
load command is used, the executable image must be located on the
client system and must be in ELF format.</P
><P
>Be aware that the gdb client is not aware of debugger commands
issued from the MDI window.  It is possible to cause the gdb client

both interfaces during the same debugging session.</P

optional feature, disabled by default because of the overheads trying
