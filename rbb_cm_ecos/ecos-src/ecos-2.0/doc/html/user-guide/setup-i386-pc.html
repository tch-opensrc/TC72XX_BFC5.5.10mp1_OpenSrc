>For information about setting up the PC to run with RedBoot,
consult the RedBoot User&quot;s Guide. If using serial debugging,
the serial line runs at 38400 baud 8-N-1 and should be connected
to the debug host using a null modem cable. If ethernet debugging
is required, an i82559 compatible network interface card, such as
an Intel EtherExpress Pro 10/100,  should be installed
on the target PC and connected to the development PC running GDB.
When RedBoot is configured appropriately to have an IP address set,
then GDB will be able to debug directly over TCP/IP to the
target PC.</P

The latest version of GRUB should be downloaded from there and installed.

Installation finished. No error reported.
This is the contents of the device map /mnt/floppy/boot/grub/device.map.

fix it and re-run the script `grub-install'.

><P
>The file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

configuration file. It contains menu items to load some of the
standard eCos tests from floppy or from partition zero of the first
hard disk. You should, of course, customize this file to load your own
application. Alternatively you can use the command-line interface of
GRUB to input commands yourself.</P
><P
>Applications can be installed, or updated simply by copying them to
the floppy disk at the location expected by the
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>menu.lst</TT
> file. For booting from floppy disks it
is recommended that the executable be stripped of all debug and symbol
table information before copying. This reduces the size of the file
and can make booting faster.</P
><P
>To install GRUB on a hard disk, refer to the GRUB documentation. Be
warned, however, that if you get this wrong it may compromise any
existing bootloader that exists on the hard disk and may make any
other operating systems unbootable. Practice on floppy disks or
sacrificial hard disks first. On machines running Red Hat Linux
version 7.2 and later, you can just add your own menu items to the
<TT

>/boot/grub/menu.lst</TT
> file that already exists.</P

NAME="AEN4457">Debugging FLOPPY and GRUB Applications</H2
><P
>When RedBoot loads an application it also provides debugging services
in the form of GDB remote protocol stubs. When an application is
loaded stand-alone from a floppy disk, or by GRUB, these services are
not present. To allow these application to be debugged, it is possible
to include GDB stubs into the application.</P
><P
>To do this, set the &quot;Support for GDB stubs&quot;
(<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_INCLUDE_STUBS</TT
>) configuration
option. Following this any application built will allow GDB to connect
to the debug serial port (by default serial device 0, also known as
COM1) whenever the application takes an exception, or if a Control-C
is typed to the debug port. Ethernet debugging is not supported.</P
><P
>The option &quot;Enable initial breakpoint&quot;
(<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_INITIAL_BREAK</TT
>) causes the HAL
to take a breakpoint immediately before calling cyg_start(). This
gives the developer a chance to set any breakpoints or inspect the
system state before it proceeds. The configuration sets this option by
default if GDB stubs are included, and this is not a RedBoot build. To
make the application execute immediately either disable this option,
or disable <TT

>CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_INCLUDE_STUBS</TT
