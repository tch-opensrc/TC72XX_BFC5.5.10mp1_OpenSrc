Board Hardware Setup</H1

>eCos comes with two Flash ROM images that provide GDB support
for the Cirrus Logic EP7211 Development Board (also known as the
EDB7211).. Note that on some board revisions, the board is silk-screened
as EDB7111-2. The first Flash ROM image provides a port of the CygMon
ROM monitor, which includes a command-line interface and a GDB remote
stub. The second Flash ROM image provides a remote GDB stub only.</P
><P
>Both ROM images are provided in the directory loaders/arm-edb7211
under the root of your eCos installation. CygMon images are prefixed
with the name 'edb7211_cygmon' and are
provided in a number of formats including binary (.bin extension)
and SREC (.srec) extension. GDB stub ROM images are given the prefix 'edb7211_gdb_module'. </P
><P
>The ROM images provided for the EP7211 Development Board must
be programmed into the FLASH. Please refer to the section titled
"Loading the ROM image into On-Board flash" on how to program the
ROM onto the board.</P
><P
>Both Cygmon and GDB Stub ROMS allow communication with GDB
via the serial connector labelled 'UART 1'. The
communication parameters are fixed at 38400 baud, 8 data bits, no
parity bit and 1 stop bit (8-N-1). No flow control is employed.
Connection to the host computer should be made using a null modem cable.
A gender changer may also be required. Note that the GDB Configuration tool
uses the serial port identifiers 0 and 1 to identify the EB7211
serial ports UART1 and UART2 respectively.</P
><P
>Both eCos and the ROM images assume the core clock is generated
with a 3.6864 MHz PLL input. The CPU will be configured to run at
73.728MHz.</P
><P
>Note: The EP7211 CPU needs a two step RESET process. After
pressing the &grave;URESET' pushbutton, the &grave;WAKEUP' pushbutton
must be pressed to complete the process.</P

>Note: </B
>When an eCos program is run on an EDB7211 board fitted with
either CygMon or a GDB stub ROM, then the code in ROM loses control.
This means that if you require the ability to remotely stop execution
on the target, or want thread debugging capabilities, you must include
GDB stub support when configuring eCos.</P

This procedure also applies for loading ROM-startup eCos programs
into the on-board FLASH memory, given a binary format image of the
program from arm-elf-objcopy.  Loading a ROM-startup eCos program
into Flash will overwrite the GDB Stub ROM/CygMon in Flash,

return to normal RAM-startup program development.</P

>You must ensure that the board has the appropriate soldered
connections. For the EP7211 this involves connecting TEST0 and TEST1
of the EP7211 to ground. To do this you must solder a wire from
ground at JP33 to TP8 and TP9.</P
><P
>With respect to using multiple devices simultaneously, note
that the EP7211 is not ID sensitive.</P
><P
>If you wish to view diagnostic output from your program that
was downloaded via the Multi-ICE, you will note that by default
the output on the serial line (as viewed by a terminal such as Hyperterm
in Windows, or cu in Unix) is in the form of GDB packets.</P
><P
>To get legible output, the solution is to set the "GDB Serial
port" to a different device from the "Diagnostic serial port", and
you should use the Diagnostic serial port to view the diagnostic
output.</P
><P
>Warning: The multi-ice-gdb-server will fail on startup if
the board has not been both reset and awakened before running the
server. </P
><P
>To resolve this, it is necessary to free up the connection
from within the ARM Multi-ICE server itself. However when this happens,
the next time you use GDB to load the program into the board, you
will see lots of "Readback did not match original data" messages
in the output of the multi-ice-gdb-server program. This indicates
your program did not load correctly, and you should restart the
multi-ice-gdb-server program, taking care to reset the board correctly
before reconnecting. </P
><P
>As a reminder, you must specify --config-dialog to the
	    multi-ice-gdb-server program to connect to the board
	    correctly. If you do not, the multi-ice-gdb-server program
	    will not be able to connect.</P
