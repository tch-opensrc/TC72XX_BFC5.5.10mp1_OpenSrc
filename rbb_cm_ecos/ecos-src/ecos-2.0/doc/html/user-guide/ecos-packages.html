CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> is a component architecture. The system comes as a
	  number of packages which can be
	  enabled or disabled as required, and new packages can be
	  added as they become available. Unfortunately, the packages
	  are not completely independent: for example the &micro;ITRON
	  compatibility package relies almost entirely on
	  functionality provided by the kernel package, and it would
	  not make sense to try to build &micro;ITRON if the kernel
	  was disabled. The C library has fewer dependencies: some
	  parts of the C library rely on kernel functionality, but it
	  is possible to disable these parts and thus build a system
	  that has the C library but no kernel. The
	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ecosconfig</B
> tool has the capability of
	    checking that all the dependencies are satisfied, but it
	    may still be possible to produce configurations that will
	    not build or (conceivably) that will build but not run.
	    Developers should be aware of this and take appropriate
	    care.</P
><P
>By default, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ecosconfig</B
> will
include all packages that are appropriate for the specified hardware
in the configuration. The common HAL package and
the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> infrastructure must be present in every configuration. In
addition, it is always necessary to have one architectural HAL package
and one platform HAL package. Other packages are optional, and can
be added or removed from a configuration as required.</P
><P
>The application may not require all of the packages; for example,
it might not need the &micro;ITRON compatibility
package, or the floating point support provided by the math library.
There is a slight overhead when <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> is built because the packages
will get compiled, and there is also a small disk space penalty.
However, any unused facilities will get stripped out at link-time,
so having redundant packages will not affect the final executable. </P
