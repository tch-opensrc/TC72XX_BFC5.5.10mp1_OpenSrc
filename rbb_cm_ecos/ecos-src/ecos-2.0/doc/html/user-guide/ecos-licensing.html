>As of May 2002, <SPAN

under a modified version of the well known <A

(GPL)</A
>, now making it an <A
HREF="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html"

GPL-compatible Free Software License</A
>. An exception clause has
been added to the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN

the circumstances in which the license applies to other code when used
in conjunction with <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN

clause is as follows:</P

>The goal of the license is to serve the
<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> user community as a whole. It allows
all <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> users to develop products without
paying anybody anything, no matter how many developers are working on
the product or how many units will be shipped. The license also
guarantees that the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> source code will
always be freely available. This applies not only to the core
<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> code itself but also to any changes
that anybody makes to the core. In particular, it should prevent any
company or individual contributing code to the system and then later
claiming that all <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> users are now guilty
of copyright or patent infringements and have to pay royalties. It
should also prevent any company from making some small improvements,
calling the result a completely new system, and releasing this under a
new and less generous license.</P
><P
>The license does <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>not</I
></SPAN
> require users to
release the source code of any <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>applications</I
></SPAN
> that
are developed with <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
>. However, if
anybody makes any changes to code covered by the
<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> license, or writes new files derived
in any way from <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> code, then we believe
that the entire user community should have the opportunity to benefit
from this. The license stipulates that these changes must be made
available in source code form to all recipients of binaries based on
the modified code, either by including the sources along with the
binaries you deliver (or with any device containing such binaries) or
with a written offer to supply the source code to the general public
for three years. It is perhaps most practical for
<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> developers to make the source code
available online and inform those who are receiving binaries
containing <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> code, and probably also the
<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> maintainers, about the location of the
code. See the <A
HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html"
TARGET="_top"
>full
text of the GPL</A
> for the most authoritative definition of the
obligations.</P
><P
>Although it is not strictly necessary to contribute the modified
code back to the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> open source project,
we are always pleased to receive code contributions and hope that
developers will also be keen to give back in return for what they
received from the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> project completely
free of charge.  The <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> maintainers are
responsible for deciding whether such contributions should be applied
to the public repository. In addition, a <A
HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/ecos/assign.html"
TARGET="_top"
>copyright
assignment</A
> is required for any significant changes to the core
<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> packages.</P
><P
>The result is a royalty-free system with minimal obligations on
the part of application developers. This has resulted in the rapid
uptake of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
>. At the same time,
<SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>eCos</SPAN
> is fully open source with all the
benefits that implies in terms of quality and innovation. We believe
that this is a winning combination.</P
