>Description</H2
><P
>Kernel counters can be used to keep track of how many times a
particular event has occurred. Usually this event is an external
signal of some sort. The most common use of counters is in the
implementation of clocks, but they can be useful with other event
sources as well. Application code can attach <A
HREF="kernel-alarms.html"
>alarms</A
> to counters, causing a function
to be called when some number of events have occurred.
      </P
><P
>A new counter is initialized by a call to
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_counter_create</TT
>. The first argument is used to
return a handle to the new counter which can be used for subsequent
operations. The second argument allows the application to provide the
memory needed for the object, thus eliminating any need for dynamic
memory allocation within the kernel. If a counter is no longer
required and does not have any alarms attached then
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_counter_delete</TT
> can be used to release the
resources, allowing the <SPAN
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>cyg_counter</SPAN
> data
structure to be re-used.
      </P
><P
>Initializing a counter does not automatically attach it to any source
of events. Instead some other code needs to call
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_counter_tick</TT
> whenever a suitable event
occurs, which will cause the counter to be incremented and may cause
alarms to trigger. The current value associated with the counter can
be retrieved using <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_counter_current_value</TT
> and
modified with <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_counter_set_value</TT
>. Typically
the latter function is only used during initialization, for example to
set a clock to wallclock time, but it can be used to reset a counter
if necessary. However <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_counter_set_value</TT
> will
never trigger any alarms. A newly initialized counter has a starting
value of 0.
      </P
><P
>The kernel provides two different implementations of counters. The
default is <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGIMP_KERNEL_COUNTERS_SINGLE_LIST</TT
> which
stores all alarms attached to the counter on a single list. This is
simple and usually efficient. However when a tick occurs the kernel
code has to traverse this list, typically at DSR level, so if there
are a significant number of alarms attached to a single counter this
will affect the system's dispatch latency. The alternative
implementation, <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGIMP_KERNEL_COUNTERS_MULTI_LIST</TT
>,
stores each alarm in one of an array of lists such that at most one of
the lists needs to be searched per clock tick. This involves extra
code and data, but can improve real-time responsiveness in some
circumstances. Another configuration option that is relevant here
is <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGIMP_KERNEL_COUNTERS_SORT_LIST</TT
>, which is
disabled by default. This provides a trade off between doing work
whenever a new alarm is added to a counter and doing work whenever a
tick occurs. It is application-dependent which of these is more
appropriate.

>Valid contexts</H2
><P
><TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_counter_create</TT
> is typically called during
system initialization but may also be called in thread context.
Similarly <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_counter_delete</TT
> may be called during
initialization or in thread context.
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_counter_current_value</TT
>,
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_counter_set_value</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_counter_tick</TT
> may be called during
initialization or from thread or DSR context. In fact,
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_counter_tick</TT
> is usually called from inside a
DSR in response to an external event of some sort.
