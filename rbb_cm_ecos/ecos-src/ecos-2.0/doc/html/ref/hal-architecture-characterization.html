>While these two operations may be implemented with inline assembler,
they are normally implemented as calls to assembly code functions in
the HAL. There are two advantages to doing it this way. First, the
return link of the call provides a convenient PC value to be used in
the saved context. Second, the calling conventions mean that the
compiler will have already saved the caller-saved registers before the
call, so the HAL need only save the callee-saved registers.</P
><P
>The implementation of <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>HAL_THREAD_SWITCH_CONTEXT()</TT
>
saves the current CPU state on the stack, including the current
interrupt state (or at least the register that contains it). For
debugging purposes it is useful to save the entire register set, but
for performance only the ABI-defined callee-saved registers need be
saved. If it is implemented, the option
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYGDBG_HAL_COMMON_CONTEXT_SAVE_MINIMUM</TT
> controls
how many registers are saved.</P
><P
>The implementation of <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>HAL_THREAD_LOAD_CONTEXT()</TT
>
loads a thread context, destroying the current context. With a little
care this can be implemented by sharing code with
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>HAL_THREAD_SWITCH_CONTEXT()</TT
>. To load a thread
context simply requires the saved registers to be restored from the
stack and a jump or return made back to the saved PC.</P
><P
>Note that interrupts are not disabled during this process, any
interrupts that occur will be delivered onto the stack to which the
current CPU stack pointer points. Hence the stack pointer
should never be invalid, or loaded with a value that might cause the
saved state to become corrupted by an interrupt. However, the current
interrupt state is saved and restored as part of the thread
context. If a thread disables interrupts and does something to cause a
context switch, interrupts may be re-enabled on switching to another
thread. Interrupts will be disabled again when the original thread
regains control.</P
