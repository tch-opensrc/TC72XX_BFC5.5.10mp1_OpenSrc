>Event flags allow a consumer thread to wait for one of several
different types of event to occur. Alternatively it is possible to
wait for some combination of events. The implementation is relatively
straightforward. Each event flag contains a 32-bit integer.
Application code associates these bits with specific events, so for
example bit 0 could indicate that an I/O operation has completed and
data is available, while bit 1 could indicate that the user has
pressed a start button. A producer thread or a DSR can cause one or
more of the bits to be set, and a consumer thread currently waiting
for these bits will be woken up.
      </P
><P
>Unlike semaphores no attempt is made to keep track of event counts. It
does not matter whether a given event occurs once or multiple times
before being consumed, the corresponding bit in the event flag will
change only once. However semaphores cannot easily be used to handle
multiple event sources. Event flags can often be used as an
alternative to condition variables, although they cannot be used for
completely arbitrary conditions and they only support the equivalent
of condition variable broadcasts, not signals.
      </P
><P
>Before an event flag can be used it must be initialized by a call to
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_flag_init</TT
>. This takes a pointer to a
<SPAN
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>cyg_flag_t</SPAN
> data structure, which can be part of a
larger structure. All 32 bits in the event flag will be set to 0,
indicating that no events have yet occurred. If an event flag is no
longer required it can be cleaned up with a call to
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_flag_destroy</TT
>, allowing the memory for the
<TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
><I
>cyg_flag_t</I
></TT
> structure to be re-used.
      </P
><P
>A consumer thread can wait for one or more events by calling
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_flag_wait</TT
>. This takes three arguments. The
first identifies a particular event flag. The second is some
combination of bits, indicating which events are of interest. The
final argument should be one of the following:

if this mode of operation is used then a single event flag cannot be
used to store disjoint sets of events, even though enough bits might
be available. Instead each disjoint set of events requires its own
event flag.

>A call to <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"

superset of the requested events. If
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_thread_release</TT

that is currently in a wait operation, the
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"

<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"

operation must succeed within the specified number of ticks, or it
will fail with a return value of 0. <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_flag_poll</TT
>
is a non-blocking variant: if the wait operation can succeed
immediately it acts like <TT

it returns immediately with a value of 0.

or from inside a DSR when an event occurs. The specified bits are or'd
into the current event flag value. This may cause a waiting thread to
be woken up, if its condition is now satisfied.
      </P
><P
><TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_flag_maskbits</TT
> can be used to clear one or
more bits in the event flag. This can be called from a producer when a
particular condition is no longer satisfied, for example when the user
is no longer pressing a particular button. It can also be used by a
consumer thread if <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYG_FLAG_WAITMODE_CLR</TT
> was not
used as part of the wait operation, to indicate that some but not all
of the active events have been consumed. If there are multiple
consumer threads performing wait operations without using
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>CYG_FLAG_WAITMODE_CLR</TT
> then typically some
additional synchronization such as a mutex is needed to prevent
multiple threads consuming the same event.
      </P
><P
>Two additional functions are provided to query the current state of an
event flag. <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_flag_peek</TT
> returns the current
value of the event flag, and <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_flag_waiting</TT
> can
be used to find out whether or not there are any threads currently
blocked on the event flag. Both of these functions must be used with
care because other threads may be operating on the event flag.
