><P
>These functions provide some control over whether or not a particular
thread can run. Apart from the required use of
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_thread_resume</TT
> to start a newly-created
thread, application code should normally use proper synchronization
primitives such as condition variables or mail boxes.

>Yield</H2
><P
><TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_thread_yield</TT
> allows a thread to relinquish
control of the processor to some other runnable thread which has the
same priority. This can have no effect on any higher-priority thread
since, if such a thread were runnable, the current thread would have
been preempted in its favour. Similarly it can have no effect on any
lower-priority thread because the current thread will always be run in
preference to those. As a consequence this function is only useful
in configurations with a scheduler that allows multiple threads to run
at the same priority, for example the mlqueue scheduler. If instead
the bitmap scheduler was being used then
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_thread_yield()</TT
> would serve no purpose.
      </P
><P
>Even if a suitable scheduler such as the mlqueue scheduler has been
configured, <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_thread_yield</TT
> will still rarely
prove useful: instead timeslicing will be used to ensure that all
threads of a given priority get a fair slice of the available
processor time. However it is possible to disable timeslicing via the
configuration option <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGSEM_KERNEL_SCHED_TIMESLICE</TT
>,
in which case <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_thread_yield</TT
> can be used to
implement a form of cooperative multitasking.

>Delay</H2
><P
><TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_thread_delay</TT
> allows a thread to suspend until
the specified number of clock ticks have occurred. For example, if a
value of 1 is used and the system clock runs at a frequency of 100Hz
then the thread will sleep for up to 10 milliseconds. This
functionality depends on the presence of a real-time system clock, as
controlled by the configuration option
<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGVAR_KERNEL_COUNTERS_CLOCK</TT
>.
      </P
><P
>If the application requires delays measured in milliseconds or similar
units rather than in clock ticks, some calculations are needed to
convert between these units as described in <A
HREF="kernel-clocks.html"
>Clocks</A
>. Usually these calculations can be done by
the application developer, or at compile-time. Performing such
calculations prior to every call to
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_thread_delay</TT
> adds unnecessary overhead to the
system.

><P
>Associated with each thread is a suspend counter. When a thread is
first created this counter is initialized to 1.
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_thread_suspend</TT
> can be used to increment the
suspend counter, and <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_thread_resume</TT
> decrements
it. The scheduler will never run a thread with a non-zero suspend
counter. Therefore a newly created thread will not run until it has
been resumed.
      </P
><P
>An occasional problem with the use of suspend and resume functionality
is that a thread gets suspended more times than it is resumed and
hence never becomes runnable again. This can lead to very confusing
behaviour. To help with debugging such problems the kernel provides a
configuration option
<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGNUM_KERNEL_MAX_SUSPEND_COUNT_ASSERT</TT
> which
imposes an upper bound on the number of suspend calls without matching
resumes, with a reasonable default value. This functionality depends
on infrastructure assertions being enabled.

>Releasing a Blocked Thread</H2
><P
>When a thread is blocked on a synchronization primitive such as a
semaphore or a mutex, or when it is waiting for an alarm to trigger,
it can be forcibly woken up using
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_thread_release</TT
>. Typically this will call the
affected synchronization primitive to return false, indicating that
the operation was not completed successfully. This function has to be
used with great care, and in particular it should only be used on
threads that have been designed appropriately and check all return
codes. If instead it were to be used on, say, an arbitrary thread that
is attempting to claim a mutex then that thread might not bother to
check the result of the mutex lock operation - usually there would be
no reason to do so. Therefore the thread will now continue running in
the false belief that it has successfully claimed a mutex lock, and
the resulting behaviour is undefined. If the system has been built
with assertions enabled then it is possible that an assertion will
trigger when the thread tries to release the mutex it does not
actually own.
      </P
><P
>The main use of <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_thread_release</TT

POSIX compatibility layer, where it is used in the implementation of
per-thread signals and cancellation handlers.
