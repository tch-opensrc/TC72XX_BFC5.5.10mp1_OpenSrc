><P
>Since some targets only have one serial connection, a serial testing harness
needs to be able to share the connection with <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GDB</SPAN
>
(however, the test and <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GDB</SPAN
> can also run on separate
lines).</P
><P
>The <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>serial filter</I
> (<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>ser_filter</SPAN
>)
sits between the serial port and <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GDB</SPAN
> and monitors
the exchange of data between <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GDB</SPAN
> and the target.
Normally, no changes are made to the data.</P
><P
>When a test request packet is sent from the test on the target, it is 
intercepted by the filter.</P
><P
>The filter and target then enter a loop, exchanging protocol data between
them which <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GDB</SPAN
> never sees.</P
><P
>In the event of a timeout, or a crash on the target, the filter falls
back into its pass-through mode. If this happens due to a crash it should be
possible to start regular debugging with <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GDB</SPAN
>. The
filter will stay in the pass-though mode until <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GDB</SPAN
>
disconnects.</P

            ensures that the serial driver will be both sending and

      Requests a transfer of text data from the target to the filter

      transfer, while the target ma be doing translations on the
      data. The target provides the filter with checksums for what it
      should expect to see. This test is not implemented yet.

the serial driver to ensure data integrity - that is the job of protocols

>In the current implementation the serial tests and the serial filter are
not resilient to such data errors. This means that the test may crash or hang

means that you should be aware of random errors - a <TT

random errors from consistent errors - the former are most likely due to noise
