><P
>Most asynchronous external interrupt vectors will point to a default
interrupt VSR which decodes the actual interrupt being delivered from
the interrupt controller and invokes the appropriate ISR.</P
><P
>The default interrupt VSR has a number of responsibilities if it is
going to interact with the Kernel cleanly and allow interrupts to
cause thread preemption.</P
><P
>To support this VSR an ISR vector table is needed. For each valid
vector three pointers need to be stored: the ISR, its data pointer and
an opaque (to the HAL) interrupt object pointer needed by the
kernel. It is implementation defined whether these are stored in a
single table of triples, or in three separate tables.</P
><P
>The VSR follows the following approximate plan:</P

>    Save the CPU state. In non-debug configurations, it may be
    possible to get away with saving less than the entire machine
    state. The option
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYGDBG_HAL_COMMON_INTERRUPTS_SAVE_MINIMUM_CONTEXT</TT
>
    is supported in some targets to do this.

>    Increment the kernel scheduler lock. This is a static member of
    the Cyg_Scheduler class, however it has also been aliased to
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>cyg_scheduler_sched_lock</TT
> so that it can be
    accessed from assembly code.

><P
>    (Optional) Switch to an interrupt stack if not already running on
    it. This allows nested interrupts to be delivered without needing
    every thread to have a stack large enough to take the maximum
    possible nesting. It is implementation defined how to detect
    whether this is a nested interrupt but there are two basic
    techniques. The first is to inspect the stack pointer and switch
    only if it is not currently within the interrupt stack range; the
    second is to maintain a counter of the interrupt nesting level and
    switch only if it is zero. The option
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYGIMP_HAL_COMMON_INTERRUPTS_USE_INTERRUPT_STACK</TT
>
    controls whether this happens.

><P
>    Decode the actual external interrupt being delivered from
    the interrupt controller. This will yield the ISR vector
    number. The code to do this usually needs to come from the
    variant or platform HAL, so is usually present in the form of a
    macro or procedure callout.
    </P

><LI
><P
>    (Optional) Re-enable interrupts to permit nesting. At this point
    we can potentially allow higher priority interrupts to occur. It
    depends on the interrupt architecture of the CPU and platform
    whether more interrupts will occur at this point, or whether they
    will only be delivered after the current interrupt has been
    acknowledged (by a call to
    <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>HAL_INTERRUPT_ACKNOWLEDGE()</TT
> in the ISR).

    ISR pointer and its data pointer from the ISR vector table.

>    Construct a C call stack frame. This may involve making stack
    space for call frames, and arguments, and initializing the back
    pointers to halt a GDB backtrace operation.
    </P

><LI
><P
>    Call the ISR, passing the vector number and data pointer.  The
    vector number and a pointer to the saved state should be preserved
    across this call, preferably by storing them in registers that are
    defined to be callee-saved by the calling conventions.
    </P

    stack is being used, switch back to the interrupted thread's
    own stack.

    pointer from the ISR vector table.

>    Call <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>interrupt_end()</TT
> passing it the return
    value from the ISR, the interrupt object pointer and a pointer to
    the saved CPU state. This function is implemented by the Kernel
    and is responsible for finishing off the interrupt
    handling. Specifically, it may post a DSR depending on the ISR
    return value, and will decrement the scheduler lock. If the lock
    is zeroed by this operation then any posted DSRs may be called and
    may in turn result in a thread context switch.
    </P

><LI
><P
>    The return from <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>interrupt_end()</TT
> may occur
    some time after the call. Many other threads may have executed in
    the meantime. So here all we may do is restore the machine state
    and resume execution of the interrupted thread. Depending on the
    architecture, it may be necessary to disable interrupts again for
    part of this.

architecture, in particular where interrupts are enabled and disabled.</P
