>SOCKET(2)                     System Calls Manual                    SOCKET(2)

NAME
     socket - create an endpoint for communication

SYNOPSIS
     #include &lt;sys/types.h&#62;
     #include &lt;sys/socket.h&#62;

     int
     socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);

DESCRIPTION
     socket() creates an endpoint for communication and returns a descriptor.

     The domain parameter specifies a communications domain within which com-
     munication will take place; this selects the protocol family which should
     be used.  These families are defined in the include file &lt;sys/socket.h&#62;.
     The currently understood formats are

           AF_UNIX         (UNIX internal protocols),
           AF_INET         (ARPA Internet protocols),
           AF_INET6        (ARPA IPv6 protocols),
           AF_ISO          (ISO protocols),
           AF_NS           (Xerox Network Systems protocols),
           AF_IPX          (Internetwork Packet Exchange), and
           AF_IMPLINK      (IMP host at IMP link layer).

     The socket has the indicated type, which specifies the semantics of com-
     munication.  Currently defined types are:

           SOCK_STREAM
           SOCK_DGRAM
           SOCK_RAW
           SOCK_SEQPACKET
           SOCK_RDM

     A SOCK_STREAM type provides sequenced, reliable, two-way connection based
     byte streams.  An out-of-band data transmission mechanism may be sup-
     ported.  A SOCK_DGRAM socket supports datagrams (connectionless, unreli-
     able messages of a fixed (typically small) maximum length).  A
     SOCK_SEQPACKET socket may provide a sequenced, reliable, two-way connec-
     tion-based data transmission path for datagrams of fixed maximum length;
     a consumer may be required to read an entire packet with each read system
     call.  This facility is protocol specific, and presently implemented only
     for PF_NS.  SOCK_RAW sockets provide access to internal network protocols
     and interfaces.  The types SOCK_RAW, which is available only to the supe-
     ruser, and SOCK_RDM, which is planned, but not yet implemented, are not
     described here.

     The protocol specifies a particular protocol to be used with the socket.
     Normally only a single protocol exists to support a particular socket
     type within a given protocol family.  However, it is possible that many
     protocols may exist, in which case a particular protocol must be speci-
     fied in this manner.  The protocol number to use is particular to the
     communication domain in which communication is to take place; see
     protocols(5).  A value of 0 for protocol will let the system select an
     appropriate protocol for the requested socket type.

     Sockets of type SOCK_STREAM are full-duplex byte streams, similar to
     pipes.  A stream socket must be in a connected state before any data may
     be sent or received on it.  A connection to another socket is created
     with a connect(2) call.  Once connected, data may be transferred using
     read(2) and write(2) calls or some variant of the send(2) and recv(2)
     calls.  When a session has been completed a close(2) may be performed.
     Out-of-band data may also be transmitted as described in send(2) and
     received as described in recv(2).

     The communications protocols used to implement a SOCK_STREAM ensure that
     data is not lost or duplicated.  If a piece of data for which the peer
     protocol has buffer space cannot be successfully transmitted within a
     reasonable length of time, then the connection is considered broken and
     calls will indicate an error with -1 returns and with ETIMEDOUT as the
     specific code in the global variable errno.  The protocols optionally
     keep sockets ``warm'' by forcing transmissions roughly every minute in
     the absence of other activity.  An error is then indicated if no response
     can be elicited on an otherwise idle connection for a extended period
     (e.g., 5 minutes).  A SIGPIPE signal is raised if a process sends on a
     broken stream; this causes naive processes, which do not handle the sig-
     nal, to exit.

     SOCK_SEQPACKET sockets employ the same system calls as SOCK_STREAM sock-
     ets.  The only difference is that read(2) calls will return only the
     amount of data requested, and any remaining in the arriving packet will
     be discarded.

     SOCK_DGRAM and SOCK_RAW sockets allow sending of datagrams to correspon-
     dents named in send(2) calls.  Datagrams are generally received with
     recvfrom(2), which returns the next datagram with its return address.

     An fcntl(2) call can be used to specify a process group to receive a
     SIGURG signal when the out-of-band data arrives.  It may also enable non-
     blocking I/O and asynchronous notification of I/O events via SIGIO.

     The operation of sockets is controlled by socket level options.  These
     options are defined in the file &lt;sys/socket.h&#62;.  setsockopt(2) and
     getsockopt(2) are used to set and get options, respectively.

RETURN VALUES
     A -1 is returned if an error occurs, otherwise the return value is a
     descriptor referencing the socket.

ERRORS
     The socket() call fails if:

     [EPROTONOSUPPORT]  The protocol type or the specified protocol is not
                        supported within this domain.

     [EMFILE]           The per-process descriptor table is full.

     [ENFILE]           The system file table is full.

     [EACCES]           Permission to create a socket of the specified type
                        and/or protocol is denied.

     [ENOBUFS]          Insufficient buffer space is available.  The socket
                        cannot be created until sufficient resources are
                        freed.
