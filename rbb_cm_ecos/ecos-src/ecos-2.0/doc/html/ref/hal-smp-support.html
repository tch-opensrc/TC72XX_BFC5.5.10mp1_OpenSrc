NAME="AEN8275">Target Hardware Limitations</H2
><P
>To allow a reasonable implementation of SMP, and to reduce the
disruption to the existing source base, a number of assumptions have
been made about the features of the target hardware.</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Modest multiprocessing. The typical number of CPUs supported is two
to four, with an upper limit around eight. While there are no
inherent limits in the code, hardware and algorithmic limitations
will probably become significant beyond this point.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>SMP synchronization support. The hardware must supply a mechanism to
allow software on two CPUs to synchronize. This is normally provided
as part of the instruction set in the form of test-and-set,
compare-and-swap or load-link/store-conditional instructions. An
alternative approach is the provision of hardware semaphore
registers which can be used to serialize implementations of these
operations. Whatever hardware facilities are available, they are
used in eCos to implement spinlocks.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Coherent caches. It is assumed that no extra effort will be required
to access shared memory from any processor. This means that either
there are no caches, they are shared by all processors, or are
maintained in a coherent state by the hardware. It would be too
disruptive to the eCos sources if every memory access had to be
bracketed by cache load/flush operations. Any hardware that requires
this is not supported.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Uniform addressing. It is assumed that all memory that is
shared between CPUs is addressed at the same location from all
CPUs. Like non-coherent caches, dealing with CPU-specific address
translation is considered too disruptive to the eCos source
base. This does not, however, preclude systems with non-uniform
access costs for different CPUs.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Uniform device addressing. As with access to memory, it is assumed
that all devices are equally accessible to all CPUs. Since device
access is often made from thread contexts, it is not possible to
restrict access to device control registers to certain CPUs, since
there is currently no support for binding or migrating threads to CPUs.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Interrupt routing. The target hardware must have an interrupt
controller that can route interrupts to specific CPUs. It is
acceptable for all interrupts to be delivered to just one CPU, or
for some interrupts to be bound to specific CPUs, or for some
interrupts to be local to each CPU. At present dynamic routing,
where a different CPU may be chosen each time an interrupt is
delivered, is not supported. ECos cannot support hardware where all
interrupts are delivered to all CPUs simultaneously with the
expectation that software will resolve any conflicts.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Inter-CPU interrupts. A mechanism to allow one CPU to interrupt
another is needed. This is necessary so that events on one CPU can
cause rescheduling on other CPUs.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>CPU Identifiers. Code running on a CPU must be able to determine
which CPU it is running on. The CPU Id is usually provided either in
a CPU status register, or in a register associated with the
inter-CPU interrupt delivery subsystem. ECos expects CPU Ids to be
small positive integers, although alternative representations, such
as bitmaps, can be converted relatively easily. Complex mechanisms
for getting the CPU Id cannot be supported. Getting the CPU Id must
be a cheap operation, since it is done often, and in performance
critical places such as interrupt handlers and the scheduler.</P
