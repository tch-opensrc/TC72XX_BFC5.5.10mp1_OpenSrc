NAME="HAL-CACHE-CONTROL">Cache Control</H1
><P
>This section contains definitions for supporting control
of the caches on the CPU.</P
><P
>These definitions are usually found in the header file
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>cyg/hal/hal_cache.h</TT
>.  This file may be defined in
the architecture, variant or platform HAL, depending on where the
caches are implemented for the target. Often there will be a generic
implementation of the cache control macros in the architecture HAL
with the ability to override or undefine them in the variant or
platform HAL. Even when the implementation of the cache macros is in
the architecture HAL, the cache dimensions will be defined in the
variant or platform HAL. As with other files, the variant or platform
specific definitions are usually found in
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>cyg/hal/var_cache.h</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>cyg/hal/plf_cache.h</TT
> respectively.  These files
are include automatically by this header, so need not be included
explicitly.</P
><P
>There are versions of the macros defined here for both the Data and
Instruction caches. these are distinguished by the use of either
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>DCACHE</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ICACHE</TT
> in the macro
names. Some architectures have a unified cache, where both data and
instruction share the same cache. In these cases the control macros
use <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>UCACHE</TT
> and the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>DCACHE</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ICACHE</TT
> macros will just be calls to the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>UCACHE</TT
> version. In the following descriptions,
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>XCACHE</TT
> is used to stand for any of these. Where
there are issues specific to a particular cache, this will be
explained in the text.</P
><P
>There might be target specific restrictions on the use of some of the
macros which it is the user's responsibility to comply with. Such
restrictions are documented in the header file with the macro
definition.</P
><P
>Note that destructive cache macros should be used with caution.
Preceding a cache invalidation with a cache synchronization is not
safe in itself since an interrupt may happen after the synchronization
but before the invalidation. This might cause the state of dirty data
lines created during the interrupt to be lost.</P
><P
>Depending on the architecture's capabilities, it may be possible to
temporarily disable the cache while doing the synchronization and
invalidation which solves the problem (no new data would be cached
during an interrupt). Otherwise it is necessary to disable interrupts
while manipulating the cache which may take a long time.</P
><P
>Some platform HALs now support a pair of cache state query
macros: <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>HAL_ICACHE_IS_ENABLED( x )</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>HAL_DCACHE_IS_ENABLED( x )</TT
> which set the argument
to true if the instruction or data cache is enabled,
respectively. Like most cache control macros, these are optional,
because the capabilities of different targets and boards can vary
considerably. Code which uses them, if it is to be considered
portable, should test for their existence first by means of
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>#ifdef</TT
>.  Be sure to include
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>&lt;cyg/hal/hal_cache.h&gt;</TT
> in order to do this
test and (maybe) use the macros.</P
