><P
>In some other operating systems the kernel provides additional
functionality. For example the kernel may also provide memory
allocation functionality, and device drivers may be part of the kernel
as well. This is not the case for eCos. Memory allocation is handled
by a separate package. Similary each device driver will typically be a
separate package. Various packages are combined and configured using
the eCos configuration technology to meet the requirements of the
application.
      </P
><P
>The eCos kernel package is optional. It is possible to write
single-threaded applications which do not use any kernel
functionality, for example RedBoot. Typically such applications are
based around a central polling loop, continually checking all devices
and taking appropriate action when I/O occurs. A small amount of
calculation is possible every iteration, at the cost of an increased
delay between an I/O event occurring and the polling loop detecting
the event. When the requirements are straightforward it may well be
easier to develop the application using a polling loop, avoiding the
complexities of multiple threads and synchronization between threads.
As requirements get more complicated a multi-threaded solution becomes
more appropriate, requiring the use of the kernel. In fact some of the
more advanced packages in eCos, for example the TCP/IP stack, use
multi-threading internally. Therefore if the application uses any of
those packages then the kernel becomes a required package, not an
optional one.
      </P
><P
>The kernel functionality can be used in one of two ways. The kernel
provides its own C API, with functions like
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_thread_create</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_mutex_lock</TT
>. These can be called directly from
application code or from other packages. Alternatively there are a
number of packages which provide compatibility with existing API's,
for example POSIX threads or &micro;ITRON. These allow application
code to call standard functions such as
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>pthread_create</TT
>, and those functions are
implemented using the basic functionality provided by the eCos kernel.
Using compatibility packages in an eCos application can make it much
easier to reuse code developed in other environments, and to share
code.
      </P
><P
>Although the different compatibility packages have similar
requirements on the underlying kernel, for example the ability to
create a new thread, there are differences in the exact semantics. For
example, strict &micro;ITRON compliance requires that kernel
timeslicing is disabled. This is achieved largely through the
configuration technology. The kernel provides a number of
configuration options that control the exact semantics that are
provided, and the various compatibility packages require particular
settings for those options. This has two important consequences.
First, it is not usually possible to have two different compatibility
packages in one eCos configuration because they will have conflicting
requirements on the underlying kernel. Second, the semantics of the
kernel's own API are only loosely defined because of the many
configuration options. For example <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_mutex_lock</TT
>
will always attempt to lock a mutex, but various configuration options
determine the behaviour when the mutex is already locked and there is
a possibility of priority inversion.
      </P
><P
>The optional nature of the kernel package presents some complications
for other code, especially device drivers. Wherever possible a device
driver should work whether or not the kernel is present. However there
are some parts of the system, especially those related to interrupt
handling, which should be implemented differently in multi-threaded
environments containing the eCos kernel and in single-threaded
environments without the kernel. To cope with both scenarios the
common HAL package provides a driver API, with functions such as
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_drv_interrupt_attach</TT
>. When the kernel package
is present these driver API functions map directly on to the
equivalent kernel functions such as
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_interrupt_attach</TT
>, using macros to avoid any
overheads. When the kernel is absent the common HAL package implements
the driver API directly, but this implementation is simpler than the
one in the kernel because it can assume a single-threaded environment.

CLASS="REFSECT1"

NAME="KERNEL-OVERVIEW-SCHEDULERS"
></A
><H2
>Schedulers</H2
><P
>When a system involves multiple threads, a scheduler is needed to
determine which thread should currently be running. The eCos kernel
can be configured with one of two schedulers, the bitmap scheduler and
the multi-level queue (MLQ) scheduler. The bitmap scheduler is
somewhat more efficient, but has a number of limitations. Most systems
will instead use the MLQ scheduler. Other schedulers may be added in
the future, either as extensions to the kernel package or in separate
packages.
      </P
><P
>Both the bitmap and the MLQ scheduler use a simple numerical priority
to determine which thread should be running. The number of priority
levels is configurable via the option
<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGNUM_KERNEL_SCHED_PRIORITIES</TT
>, but a typical
system will have up to 32 priority levels. Therefore thread priorities
will be in the range 0 to 31, with 0 being the highest priority and 31
the lowest. Usually only the system's idle thread will run at the
lowest priority. Thread priorities are absolute, so the kernel will
only run a lower-priority thread if all higher-priority threads are
currently blocked.
      </P
><P
>The bitmap scheduler only allows one thread per priority level, so if
the system is configured with 32 priority levels then it is limited to
only 32 threads &#8212; still enough for many applications. A simple
bitmap can be used to keep track of which threads are currently
runnable. Bitmaps can also be used to keep track of threads waiting on
a mutex or other synchronization primitive. Identifying the
highest-priority runnable or waiting thread involves a simple
operation on the bitmap, and an array index operation can then be used
to get hold of the thread data structure itself. This makes the
bitmap scheduler fast and totally deterministic.
      </P
><P
>The MLQ scheduler allows multiple threads to run at the same priority.
This means that there is no limit on the number of threads in the
system, other than the amount of memory available. However operations
such as finding the highest priority runnable thread are a little bit
more expensive than for the bitmap scheduler.
      </P
><P
>Optionally the MLQ scheduler supports timeslicing, where the scheduler
automatically switches from one runnable thread to another when some
number of clock ticks have occurred. Timeslicing only comes into play
when there are two runnable threads at the same priority and no higher
priority runnable threads. If timeslicing is disabled then a thread
will not be preempted by another thread of the same priority, and will
continue running until either it explicitly yields the processor or
until it blocks by, for example, waiting on a synchronization
primitive. The configuration options
<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGSEM_KERNEL_SCHED_TIMESLICE</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGNUM_KERNEL_SCHED_TIMESLICE_TICKS</TT
> control
timeslicing. The bitmap scheduler does not provide timeslicing
support. It only allows one thread per priority level, so it is not
possible to preempt the current thread in favour of another one with
the same priority.
      </P
><P
>Another important configuration option that affects the MLQ scheduler
is <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGIMP_KERNEL_SCHED_SORTED_QUEUES</TT
>. This
determines what happens when a thread blocks, for example by waiting
on a semaphore which has no pending events. The default behaviour of
the system is last-in-first-out queuing. For example if several
threads are waiting on a semaphore and an event is posted, the thread
that gets woken up is the last one that called
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_semaphore_wait</TT
>. This allows for a simple and
fast implementation of both the queue and dequeue operations. However
if there are several queued threads with different priorities, it may
not be the highest priority one that gets woken up. In practice this
is rarely a problem: usually there will be at most one thread waiting
on a queue, or when there are several threads they will be of the same
priority. However if the application does require strict priority
queueing then the option
<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGIMP_KERNEL_SCHED_SORTED_QUEUES</TT
> should be
enabled. There are disadvantages: more work is needed whenever a
thread is queued, and the scheduler needs to be locked for this
operation so the system's dispatch latency is worse. If the bitmap
scheduler is used then priority queueing is automatic and does not
involve any penalties.
      </P
><P
>Some kernel functionality is currently only supported with the MLQ
scheduler, not the bitmap scheduler. This includes support for SMP
systems, and protection against priority inversion using either mutex
priority ceilings or priority inheritance.

<A
HREF="kernel-flags.html"

      </P
><P
>Mutexes serve a very different purpose from the other primitives. A
mutex allows multiple threads to share a resource safely: a thread
locks a mutex, manipulates the shared resource, and then unlocks the
mutex again. The other primitives are used to communicate information
between threads, or alternatively from a DSR associated with an
interrupt handler to a thread.
      </P
><P
>When a thread that has locked a mutex needs to wait for some condition
to become true, it should use a condition variable. A condition
variable is essentially just a place for a thread to wait, and which
another thread, or DSR, can use to wake it up. When a thread waits on
a condition variable it releases the mutex before waiting, and when it
wakes up it reacquires it before proceeding. These operations are
atomic so that synchronization race conditions cannot be introduced.
      </P
><P
>A counting semaphore is used to indicate that a particular event has
occurred. A consumer thread can wait for this event to occur, and a
producer thread or a DSR can post the event. There is a count
associated with the semaphore so if the event occurs multiple times in
quick succession this information is not lost, and the appropriate
number of semaphore wait operations will succeed.
      </P
><P
>Mail boxes are also used to indicate that a particular event has
occurred, and allows for one item of data to be exchanged per event.
Typically this item of data would be a pointer to some data structure.
Because of the need to store this extra data, mail boxes have a
finite capacity. If a producer thread generates mail box events
faster than they can be consumed then, to avoid overflow, it will be
blocked until space is again available in the mail box. This means
that mail boxes usually cannot be used by a DSR to wake up a
thread. Instead mail boxes are typically only used between threads.
      </P
><P
>Event flags can be used to wait on some number of different events,
and to signal that one or several of these events have occurred. This
is achieved by associating bits in a bit mask with the different
events. Unlike a counting semaphore no attempt is made to keep track
of the number of events that have occurred, only the fact that an
event has occurred at least once. Unlike a mail box it is not
possible to send additional data with the event, but this does mean
that there is no possibility of an overflow and hence event flags can
be used between a DSR and a thread as well as between threads.
      </P
><P
>The eCos common HAL package provides its own device driver API which
contains some of the above synchronization primitives. These allow
the DSR for an interrupt handler to signal events to higher-level
code. If the configuration includes the eCos kernel package then
the driver API routines map directly on to the equivalent kernel
routines, allowing interrupt handlers to interact with threads. If the
kernel package is not included and the application consists of just a
single thread running in polled mode then the driver API is
implemented entirely within the common HAL, and with no need to worry
about multiple threads the implementation can obviously be rather
simpler.

><H2
>Threads and Interrupt Handling</H2
><P
>During normal operation the processor will be running one of the
threads in the system. This may be an application thread, a system
thread running inside say the TCP/IP stack, or the idle thread. From
time to time a hardware interrupt will occur, causing control to be
transferred briefly to an interrupt handler. When the interrupt has
been completed the system's scheduler will decide whether to return
control to the interrupted thread or to some other runnable thread.
      </P
><P
>Threads and interrupt handlers must be able to interact. If a thread
is waiting for some I/O operation to complete, the interrupt handler
associated with that I/O must be able to inform the thread that the
operation has completed. This can be achieved in a number of ways. One
very simple approach is for the interrupt handler to set a volatile
variable. A thread can then poll continuously until this flag is set,
possibly sleeping for a clock tick in between. Polling continuously
means that the cpu time is not available for other activities, which
may be acceptable for some but not all applications. Polling once
every clock tick imposes much less overhead, but means that the thread
may not detect that the I/O event has occurred until an entire clock
tick has elapsed. In typical systems this could be as long as 10
milliseconds. Such a delay might be acceptable for some applications,
but not all.
      </P
><P
>A better solution would be to use one of the synchronization
primitives. The interrupt handler could signal a condition variable,
post to a semaphore, or use one of the other primitives. The thread
would perform a wait operation on the same primitive. It would not
consume any cpu cycles until the I/O event had occurred, and when the
event does occur the thread can start running again immediately
(subject to any higher priority threads that might also be runnable).
      </P
><P
>Synchronization primitives constitute shared data, so care must be
taken to avoid problems with concurrent access. If the thread that was
interrupted was just performing some calculations then the interrupt
handler could manipulate the synchronization primitive quite safely.
However if the interrupted thread happened to be inside some kernel
call then there is a real possibility that some kernel data structure
will be corrupted. 
      </P
><P
>One way of avoiding such problems would be for the kernel functions to
disable interrupts when executing any critical region. On most
architectures this would be simple to implement and very fast, but it
would mean that interrupts would be disabled often and for quite a
long time. For some applications that might not matter, but many
embedded applications require that the interrupt handler run as soon
as possible after the hardware interrupt has occurred. If the kernel
relied on disabling interrupts then it would not be able to support
such applications.
      </P
><P
>Instead the kernel uses a two-level approach to interrupt handling.
Associated with every interrupt vector is an Interrupt Service Routine
or ISR, which will run as quickly as possible so that it can service
the hardware. However an ISR can make only a small number of kernel
calls, mostly related to the interrupt subsystem, and it cannot make
any call that would cause a thread to wake up. If an ISR detects that
an I/O operation has completed and hence that a thread should be woken
up, it can cause the associated Deferred Service Routine or DSR to
run. A DSR is allowed to make more kernel calls, for example it can
signal a condition variable or post to a semaphore.
      </P
><P
>Disabling interrupts prevents ISRs from running, but very few parts of
the system disable interrupts and then only for short periods of time.
The main reason for a thread to disable interrupts is to manipulate
some state that is shared with an ISR. For example if a thread needs
to add another buffer to a linked list of free buffers and the ISR may
remove a buffer from this list at any time, the thread would need to
disable interrupts for the few instructions needed to manipulate the
list. If the hardware raises an interrupt at this time, it remains
pending until interrupts are reenabled.
      </P
><P
>Analogous to interrupts being disabled or enabled, the kernel has a
scheduler lock. The various kernel functions such as
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_mutex_lock</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_semaphore_post</TT
> will claim the scheduler lock,
manipulate the kernel data structures, and then release the scheduler
lock. If an interrupt results in a DSR being requested and the
scheduler is currently locked, the DSR remains pending. When the
scheduler lock is released any pending DSRs will run. These may post
events to synchronization primitives, causing other higher priority
threads to be woken up.
      </P
><P
>For an example, consider the following scenario. The system has a high
priority thread A, responsible for processing some data coming from an
external device. This device will raise an interrupt when data is
available. There are two other threads B and C which spend their time
performing calculations and occasionally writing results to a display
of some sort. This display is a shared resource so a mutex is used to
control access.
      </P
><P
>At a particular moment in time thread A is likely to be blocked,
waiting on a semaphore or another synchronization primitive until data
is available. Thread B might be running performing some calculations,
and thread C is runnable waiting for its next timeslice. Interrupts
are enabled, and the scheduler is unlocked because none of the threads
are in the middle of a kernel operation. At this point the device
raises an interrupt. The hardware transfers control to a low-level
interrupt handler provided by eCos which works out exactly which
interrupt occurs, and then the corresponding ISR is run. This ISR
manipulates the hardware as appropriate, determines that there is now
data available, and wants to wake up thread A by posting to the
semaphore. However ISR's are not allowed to call
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_semaphore_post</TT
> directly, so instead the ISR
requests that its associated DSR be run and returns. There are no more
interrupts to be processed, so the kernel next checks for DSR's. One
DSR is pending and the scheduler is currently unlocked, so the DSR can
run immediately and post the semaphore. This will have the effect of
making thread A runnable again, so the scheduler's data structures are
adjusted accordingly. When the DSR returns thread B is no longer the
highest priority runnable thread so it will be suspended, and instead
thread A gains control over the cpu.
      </P
><P
>In the above example no kernel data structures were being manipulated
at the exact moment that the interrupt happened. However that cannot
be assumed. Suppose that thread B had finished its current set of
calculations and wanted to write the results to the display. It would
claim the appropriate mutex and manipulate the display. Now suppose
that thread B was timesliced in favour of thread C, and that thread C
also finished its calculations and wanted to write the results to the
display. It would call <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_mutex_lock</TT
>. This
kernel call locks the scheduler, examines the current state of the
mutex, discovers that the mutex is already owned by another thread,
suspends the current thread, and switches control to another runnable
thread. Another interrupt happens in the middle of this
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_mutex_lock</TT
> call, causing the ISR to run
immediately. The ISR decides that thread A should be woken up so it
requests that its DSR be run and returns back to the kernel. At this
point there is a pending DSR, but the scheduler is still locked by the
call to <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_mutex_lock</TT
> so the DSR cannot run
immediately. Instead the call to <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_mutex_lock</TT
>
is allowed to continue, which at some point involves unlocking the
scheduler. The pending DSR can now run, safely post the semaphore, and
thus wake up thread A.
      </P
><P
>If the ISR had called <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_semaphore_post</TT
> directly
rather than leaving it to a DSR, it is likely that there would have
been some sort of corruption of a kernel data structure. For example
the kernel might have completely lost track of one of the threads, and
that thread would never have run again. The two-level approach to
interrupt handling, ISR's and DSR's, prevents such problems with no
need to disable interrupts.

It is permitted to lock and unlock a mutex: there are no other threads

During this time the system is running at ISR context, and most of the
kernel function calls are disallowed. This includes the various
synchronization primitives, so for example an ISR is not allowed to
post to a semaphore to indicate that an event has happened. Usually
the only operations that should be performed from inside an ISR are

Instead they contain various assertions, which can be enabled or
disabled. During the development process assertions are normally left
enabled, and the various kernel functions will perform parameter
checks and other system consistency checks. If a problem is detected
then an assertion failure will be reported and the application will be
terminated. In a typical debug session a suitable breakpoint will have
been installed and the developer can now examine the state of the
system and work out exactly what is going on. Towards the end of the
development cycle assertions will be disabled by manipulating
configuration options within the eCos infrastructure package, and all
assertions will be eliminated at compile-time. The assumption is that
by this time the application code has been mostly debugged: the
initial version of the code might have tried to perform a semaphore
operation on a mutex, but any problems like that will have been fixed
some time ago. This approach has a number of advantages:

reasonable for the system to do more work during the development

it is possible to give a text message describing the error rather than
just return an error code.

>Although none of the kernel functions return an error code, many of
them do return a status condition. For example the function
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"

event has been posted to a semaphore, or until a certain number of
clock ticks have occurred. Usually the calling code will need to know
whether the wait operation succeeded or whether a timeout occurred.
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"

return value of zero or false indicates a timeout, a non-zero return
value indicates that the wait succeeded.

>In conventional APIs one common error conditions is lack of memory.
For example the POSIX function <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>pthread_create</TT
>
usually has to allocate some memory dynamically for the thread stack
and other per-thread data. If the target hardware does not have enough
memory to meet all demands, or more commonly if the application
contains a memory leak, then there may not be enough memory available
and the function call would fail. The eCos kernel avoids such problems
by never performing any dynamic memory allocation. Instead it is the
responsibility of the application code to provide all the memory
required for kernel data structures and other needs. In the case of
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_thread_create</TT
> this means a
<SPAN
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>cyg_thread</SPAN
> data structure to hold the thread
details, and a <SPAN
CLASS="TYPE"
>char</SPAN
> array for the thread stack.
      </P
><P
>In many applications this approach results in all data structures
being allocated statically rather than dynamically. This has several
advantages. If the application is in fact too large for the target
hardware's memory then there will be an error at link-time rather than
at run-time, making the problem much easier to diagnose. Static
allocation does not involve any of the usual overheads associated with
dynamic allocation, for example there is no need to keep track of the
various free blocks in the system, and it may be possible to eliminate
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>malloc</TT
> from the system completely. Problems such
as fragmentation and memory leaks cannot occur if all data is
allocated statically. However, some applications are sufficiently
complicated that dynamic memory allocation is required, and the
various kernel functions do not distinguish between statically and
dynamically allocated memory. It still remains the responsibility of
the calling code to ensure that sufficient memory is available, and
passing null pointers to the kernel will result in assertions or
system failure.
