>eCos contains support for limited Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP).
This is only available on selected architectures and platforms.
The implementation has a number of restrictions on the kind of
hardware supported. These are described in <A
HREF="hal-smp-support.html"
>the Section called <I
>SMP Support</I
> in Chapter 9</A
>.
    </P

>The following sections describe the changes that have been made to the
eCos kernel to support SMP operation.

><H2
>System Startup</H2
><P
>The system startup sequence needs to be somewhat different on an SMP
system, although this is largely transparent to application code. The
main startup takes place on only one CPU, called the primary CPU. All
other CPUs, the secondary CPUs, are either placed in suspended state
at reset, or are captured by the HAL and put into a spin as they start
up. The primary CPU is responsible for copying the DATA segment and
zeroing the BSS (if required), calling HAL variant and platform
initialization routines and invoking constructors. It then calls
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_start</TT
> to enter the application. The
application may then create extra threads and other objects.
      </P
><P
>It is only when the application calls
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_scheduler_start</TT
> that the secondary CPUs are
initialized. This routine scans the list of available secondary CPUs
and invokes <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>HAL_SMP_CPU_START</TT
> to start each
CPU. Finally it calls an internal function
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>Cyg_Scheduler::start_cpu</TT
> to enter the scheduler
for the primary CPU.
      </P
><P
>Each secondary CPU starts in the HAL, where it completes any per-CPU
initialization before calling into the kernel at
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_kernel_cpu_startup</TT
>. Here it claims the
scheduler lock and calls
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>Cyg_Scheduler::start_cpu</TT
>.
      </P
><P
><TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>Cyg_Scheduler::start_cpu</TT
> is common to both the
primary and secondary CPUs. The first thing this code does is to
install an interrupt object for this CPU's inter-CPU interrupt. From
this point on the code is the same as for the single CPU case: an
initial thread is chosen and entered.
      </P
><P
>From this point on the CPUs are all equal, eCos makes no further
distinction between the primary and secondary CPUs. However, the
hardware may still distinguish between them as far as interrupt
delivery is concerned.

NAME="KERNEL-SMP-SCHEDULING"
></A
><H2
>Scheduling</H2
><P
>To function correctly an operating system kernel must protect its
vital data structures, such as the run queues, from concurrent
access. In a single CPU system the only concurrent activities to worry
about are asynchronous interrupts. The kernel can easily guard its
data structures against these by disabling interrupts. However, in a
multi-CPU system, this is inadequate since it does not block access by
other CPUs.
      </P
><P
>The eCos kernel protects its vital data structures using the scheduler
lock. In single CPU systems this is a simple counter that is
atomically incremented to acquire the lock and decremented to release
it. If the lock is decremented to zero then the scheduler may be
invoked to choose a different thread to run. Because interrupts may
continue to be serviced while the scheduler lock is claimed, ISRs are
not allowed to access kernel data structures, or call kernel routines
that can. Instead all such operations are deferred to an associated
DSR routine that is run during the lock release operation, when the
data structures are in a consistent state.
      </P
><P
>By choosing a kernel locking mechanism that does not rely on interrupt
manipulation to protect data structures, it is easier to convert eCos
to SMP than would otherwise be the case. The principal change needed to
make eCos SMP-safe is to convert the scheduler lock into a nestable
spin lock. This is done by adding a spinlock and a CPU id to the
original counter.
      </P
><P
>The algorithm for acquiring the scheduler lock is very simple. If the
scheduler lock's CPU id matches the current CPU then it can just increment
the counter and continue. If it does not match, the CPU must spin on
the spinlock, after which it may increment the counter and store its
own identity in the CPU id.
      </P
><P
>To release the lock, the counter is decremented. If it goes to zero
the CPU id value must be set to NONE and the spinlock cleared.
      </P
><P
>To protect these sequences against interrupts, they must be performed
with interrupts disabled. However, since these are very short code
sequences, they will not have an adverse effect on the interrupt
latency.
      </P
><P
>Beyond converting the scheduler lock, further preparing the kernel for
SMP is a relatively minor matter. The main changes are to convert
various scalar housekeeping variables into arrays indexed by CPU
id. These include the current thread pointer, the need_reschedule
flag and the timeslice counter.
      </P
><P
>At present only the Multi-Level Queue (MLQ) scheduler is capable of
supporting SMP configurations. The main change made to this scheduler
is to cope with having several threads in execution at the same
time. Running threads are marked with the CPU that they are executing on.
When scheduling a thread, the scheduler skips past any running threads
until it finds a thread that is pending. While not a constant-time
algorithm, as in the single CPU case, this is still deterministic,
since the worst case time is bounded by the number of CPUs in the
system.
      </P
><P
>A second change to the scheduler is in the code used to decide when
the scheduler should be called to choose a new thread. The scheduler
attempts to keep the <SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>n</SPAN
> CPUs running the
<SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>n</SPAN
> highest priority threads. Since an event or
interrupt on one CPU may require a reschedule on another CPU, there
must be a mechanism for deciding this. The algorithm currently
implemented is very simple. Given a thread that has just been awakened
(or had its priority changed), the scheduler scans the CPUs, starting
with the one it is currently running on, for a current thread that is
of lower priority than the new one. If one is found then a reschedule
interrupt is sent to that CPU and the scan continues, but now using
the current thread of the rescheduled CPU as the candidate thread. In
this way the new thread gets to run as quickly as possible, hopefully
on the current CPU, and the remaining CPUs will pick up the remaining
highest priority threads as a consequence of processing the reschedule
interrupt.
      </P
><P
>The final change to the scheduler is in the handling of
timeslicing. Only one CPU receives timer interrupts, although all CPUs
must handle timeslicing. To make this work, the CPU that receives the
timer interrupt decrements the timeslice counter for all CPUs, not
just its own. If the counter for a CPU reaches zero, then it sends a
timeslice interrupt to that CPU. On receiving the interrupt the
destination CPU enters the scheduler and looks for another thread at
the same priority to run. This is somewhat more efficient than
distributing clock ticks to all CPUs, since the interrupt is only
needed when a timeslice occurs.
      </P
><P
>All existing synchronization mechanisms work as before in an SMP
system. Additional synchronization mechanisms have been added to
provide explicit synchronization for SMP, in the form of
<A

><H2
>SMP Interrupt Handling</H2
><P
>The main area where the SMP nature of a system requires special
attention is in device drivers and especially interrupt handling. It
is quite possible for the ISR, DSR and thread components of a device
driver to execute on different CPUs. For this reason it is much more
important that SMP-capable device drivers use the interrupt-related
functions correctly. Typically a device driver would use the driver
API rather than call the kernel directly, but it is unlikely that
anybody would attempt to use a multiprocessor system without the
kernel package.
      </P
><P
>Two new functions have been added to the Kernel API
to do <A
HREF="kernel-interrupts.html#KERNEL-INTERRUPTS-SMP"
>interrupt
routing</A
>: <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_interrupt_set_cpu</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_interrupt_get_cpu</TT
>. Although not currently
supported, special values for the cpu argument may be used in future
to indicate that the interrupt is being routed dynamically or is
CPU-local. Once a vector has been routed to a new CPU, all other
interrupt masking and configuration operations are relative to that
CPU, where relevant.

systems in <A
