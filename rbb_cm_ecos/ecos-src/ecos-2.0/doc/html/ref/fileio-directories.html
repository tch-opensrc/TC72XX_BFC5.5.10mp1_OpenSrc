NAME="FILEIO-DIRECTORIES">Chapter 23. Directories</H1
><P
>Filesystem operations all take a directory pointer as one of their
arguments.  A directory pointer is an opaque handle managed by the
filesystem. It should encapsulate a reference to a specific directory
within the filesystem. For example, it may be a pointer to the data
structure that represents that directory (such as an inode), or a
pointer to a pathname for the directory.</P
><P
>The <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>chdir()</TT
> filesystem function pointer has two
modes of use. When passed a pointer in the
<TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"
><I
>dir_out</I
></TT
> argument, it should locate the named
directory and place a directory pointer there. If the
<TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"
><I
>dir_out</I
></TT
> argument is NULL then the
<TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"
><I
>dir</I
></TT
> argument is a previously generated
directory pointer that can now be disposed of. When the infrastructure
is implementing the <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>chdir()</TT
> function it makes two
calls to filesystem <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>chdir()</TT
> functions. The first
is to get a directory pointer for the new current directory. If this
succeeds the second is to dispose of the old current directory
pointer.</P
><P
>The <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>opendir()</TT
> function is used to open a
directory for reading. This results in an open file object that can be
read to return a sequence of <SPAN
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>struct dirent</SPAN
>
objects. The only operations that are allowed on this file are
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>read</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>lseek</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>close</TT
>. Each read operation on this file should
return a single <SPAN
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>struct dirent</SPAN
> object. When
the end of the directory is reached, zero should be returned. The only
seek operation allowed is a rewind to the start of the directory, by
supplying an offset of zero and a <TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"
><I
>whence</I
></TT
>
specifier of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SEEK_SET</TT
>.</P
><P
>Most of these considerations are invisible to clients of a filesystem
since they will access directories via the POSIX
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>opendir()</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>readdir()</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>closedir()</TT
> functions.</P
><P
>Support for the <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>getcwd()</TT
> function is provided by
three mechanisms.  The first is to use the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>FS_INFO_GETCWD</TT
> getinfo key on the filesystem to use
any internal support that it has for this. If that fails it falls back
on one of the two other mechanisms. If
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYGPKG_IO_FILEIO_TRACK_CWD</TT
> is set then the current
directory is tracked textually in <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>chdir()</TT
> and the result of that is
reported in getcwd(). Otherwise an attempt is made to traverse the
directory tree to its root using &quot;..&quot; entries.</P
><P
>This last option is complicated and expensive, and relies on the
filesystem supporting &quot;.&quot; and &quot;..&quot;  entries. This is not always the
case, particularly if the filesystem has been ported from a
non-UNIX-compatible source. Tracking the pathname textually will
usually work, but might not produce optimum results when symbolic
links are being used.</P
