>For each interface in turn, this test attempts to read by
tftp from the server, a file called
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>tftp_get</TT
>
and
prints the status and contents it read (if any).  It then writes
the same data to a file called
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>tftp_put</TT
>
on
the same server.</P
><P
>In order for this to succeed, both files must already exist.
 The TFTP protocol does not require that a WRQ request _create_ a
file, just that it can write it.  The TFTP server on Linux certainly
will only allow writes to an existing file, given the appropriate
permission.  Thus, you need to have these files in place, with proper permission,
before running the test.</P
><P
>The conventional place for the tftp server to operate in LINUX
is /tftpboot/; you will likely need root privileges
to create files there. The data contents of
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>tftp_get</TT
>
can
be anything you like, but anything very large will waste lots of
time printing it on the test&#8217;s stdout, and anything above
32kB will cause a buffer overflow and unpredictable failure.</P
><P
>Creating an empty tftp_put file (eg. by copying /dev/null
to it) is neatest.  So before the test you should have something
like:</P

><P
>This test is truly interactive, in that you can use a standard
tftp application to get and put files from the server, during the
5 minutes that it runs.  The dummy filesystem which underlies the
server initially contains one file, called &#8220;uu&#8221; which contains
part of a familiar text and some padding.  It also accommodates
creation of 3 further files of up to 1Mb in size and names of up
to 256 bytes.  Exceeding these limits will cause a buffer overflow
and unpredictable failure.</P
><P
>The dummy filesystem is an implementation of the generic API
which allows a true filesystem to be attached to the tftp server
in the network stack.</P
><P
>We have been testing the tftp server by running the test on
the target board, then using two different host computers connecting
to the different target interfaces, putting a file from each, getting
the &#8220;uu&#8221; file, and getting the file from the other computer.
 This verifies that data is preserved during the transfer as well
as interworking with standard tftp applications.</P
