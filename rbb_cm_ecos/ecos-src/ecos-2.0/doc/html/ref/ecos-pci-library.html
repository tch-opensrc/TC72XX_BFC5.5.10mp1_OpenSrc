NAME="AEN12691">PCI Overview</H2
><P
>The PCI bus supports several address spaces: memory, IO, and configuration. All PCI
devices must support mandatory configuration space registers. Some devices may also present
IO mapped and/or memory mapped resources. Before devices on the bus can be used, they must
be configured. Basically, configuration will assign PCI IO and/or memory address ranges to
each device and then enable that device. All PCI devices have a unique address in
configuration space. This address is comprised of a bus number, a device number, and a
function number. Special devices called bridges are used to connect two PCI busses together.
The PCI standard supports up to 255 busses with each bus having up to 32 devices and each
device having up to 8 functions.</P
><P
>The environment in which a platform operates will dictate if and how eCos should
configure devices on the PCI bus. If the platform acts as a host on a single PCI bus,
then devices may be configured individually from the relevant device driver. If the
platform is not the primary host, such as a PCI card plugged into a PC, configuration
of PCI devices may be left to the PC BIOS. If PCI-PCI bridges are involved, configuration
of all devices is best done all at once early in the boot process. This is because all
devices on the secondary side of a bridge must be evaluated for their IO and memory space
requirements before the bridge can be configured.</P

NAME="AEN12695">Initializing the bus</H2
><P
>The PCI bus needs to be initialized before it can be used.
This only needs to be done once - some HALs may do it as part of
the platform initialization procedure, other HALs may leave it to
the application or device drivers to do it. The following function
will do the initialization only once, so it's safe to call from
multiple drivers:</P
