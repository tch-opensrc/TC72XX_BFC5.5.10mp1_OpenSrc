>Most of the HAL consists of simple macros or functions that are
called via the interfaces described in the previous section. These
just perform whatever operation is required by accessing the hardware
and then return. The exception to this is the handling of exceptions:
either synchronous hardware traps or asynchronous device
interrupts. Here control is passed first to the HAL, which then passed
it on to eCos or the application. After eCos has finished with it,
control is then passed back to the HAL for it to tidy up the CPU state
and resume processing from the point at which the exception occurred.</P
><P
>The HAL exceptions handling code is usually found in the file
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>vectors.S</TT
> in the architecture HAL.  Since the
reset entry point is usually implemented as one of these it also deals
with system startup.</P
><P
>The exact implementation of this code is under the control of the HAL
implementer. So long as it interacts correctly with the interfaces
defined previously it may take any form.  However, all current
implementation follow the same pattern, and there should be a very
good reason to break with this. The rest of this section describes
these operate.</P

>Execution normally begins at the reset vector with
the machine in a minimal startup state. From here the HAL needs to get
the machine running, set up the execution environment for the
application, and finally invoke its entry point.</P

>The following is a list of the jobs that need to be done in
approximately the order in which they should be accomplished. Many
of these will not be needed in some configurations.</P

>  Initialize the hardware. This may involve initializing several
  subsystems in both the architecture, variant and platform
  HALs. These include:
  </P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>	Initialize various CPU status registers. Most importantly, the CPU
	interrupt mask should be set to disable interrupts.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	Initialize the MMU, if it is used. On many platforms it is
	only possible to control the cacheability of address ranges
	via the MMU. Also, it may be necessary to remap RAM and device
	registers to locations other than their defaults. However, for
	simplicity, the mapping should be kept as close to one-to-one
	physical-to-virtual as possible.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	Set up the memory controller to access RAM, ROM and I/O devices
	correctly. Until this is done it may not be possible to access
	RAM. If this is a ROMRAM startup then the program code can
	now be copied to its RAM address and control transferred to it.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	Set up any bus bridges and support chips. Often access to
	device registers needs to go through various bus bridges and
	other intermediary devices. In many systems these are combined
	with the memory controller, so it makes sense to set these up
	together. This is particularly important if early diagnostic
	output needs to go through one of these devices.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	Set up diagnostic mechanisms. If the platform includes an LED or
	LCD output device, it often makes sense to output progress
	indications on this during startup. This helps with diagnosing
	hardware and software errors.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	Initialize floating point and other extensions such as SIMD
	and multimedia engines. It is usually necessary to enable
	these and maybe initialize control and exception registers for
	these extensions.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	Initialize interrupt controller. At the very least, it should
	be configured to mask all interrupts. It may also be necessary
	to set up the mapping from the interrupt controller's vector
	number space to the CPU's exception number space. Similar
	mappings may need to be set up between primary and secondary
	interrupt controllers.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	Disable and initialize the caches. The caches should not
	normally be enabled at this point, but it may be necessary to
	clear or initialize them so that they can be enabled
	later. Some architectures require that the caches be
	explicitly reinitialized after a power-on reset.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	Initialize the timer, clock etc. While the timer used for RTC
	interrupts will be initialized later, it may be necessary to
	set up the clocks that drive it here.
	</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>    The exact order in which these initializations is done is
    architecture or variant specific. It is also often not necessary
    to do anything at all for some of these options. These fragments
    of code should concentrate on getting the target up and running so
    that C function calls can be made and code can be run. More
    complex initializations that cannot be done in assembly code may
    be postponed until calls to
    <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>hal_variant_init()</TT
> or
    <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>hal_platform_init()</TT
> are made.
    </P
><P
>    Not all of these initializations need to be done for all startup
    types. In particular, RAM startups can reasonably assume that the
    ROM monitor or loader has already done most of this work.
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    Set up the stack pointer, this allows subsequent initialization
    code to make proper procedure calls. Usually the interrupt stack
    is used for this purpose since it is available, large enough, and
    will be reused for other purposes later.
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>    Initialize any global pointer register needed for access to
    globally defined variables. This allows subsequent initialization
    code to access global variables.

    stack space for call frames, and arguments, and initializing the
    back pointers to halt a GDB backtrace operation.

CLASS="FUNCTION"
