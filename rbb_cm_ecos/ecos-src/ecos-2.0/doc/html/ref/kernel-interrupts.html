>Description</H2
><P
>The kernel provides an interface for installing interrupt handlers and
controlling when interrupts occur. This functionality is used
primarily by eCos device drivers and by any application code that
interacts directly with hardware. However in most cases it is better
to avoid using this kernel functionality directly, and instead the
device driver API provided by the common HAL package should be used.
Use of the kernel package is optional, and some applications such as
RedBoot work with no need for multiple threads or synchronization
primitives. Any code which calls the kernel directly rather than the
device driver API will not function in such a configuration. When the
kernel package is present the device driver API is implemented as
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>#define</TT
>'s to the equivalent kernel calls, otherwise
it is implemented inside the common HAL package. The latter
implementation can be simpler than the kernel one because there is no
need to consider thread preemption and similar issues.
      </P
><P
>The exact details of interrupt handling vary widely between
architectures. The functionality provided by the kernel abstracts away
from many of the details of the underlying hardware, thus simplifying
application development. However this is not always successful. For
example, if some hardware does not provide any support at all for
masking specific interrupts then calling
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_interrupt_mask</TT
> may not behave as intended:
instead of masking just the one interrupt source it might disable all
interrupts, because that is as close to the desired behaviour as is
possible given the hardware restrictions. Another possibility is that
masking a given interrupt source also affects all lower-priority
interrupts, but still allows higher-priority ones. The documentation
for the appropriate HAL packages should be consulted for more
information about exactly how interrupts are handled on any given
hardware. The HAL header files will also contain useful information.

Interrupts may currently be disabled globally, especially if the
hardware does not support interrupt priorities. Alternatively
interrupts may be enabled such that higher priority interrupts are
allowed through. The ISR may be running on a separate interrupt stack,
or on the stack of whichever thread was running at the time the
interrupt happened.
          </P
><P
>A typical ISR will do as little work as possible, just enough to meet
the needs of the hardware and then acknowledge the interrupt by
calling <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_interrupt_acknowledge</TT
>. This ensures
that interrupts will be quickly reenabled, so higher priority devices
can be serviced. For some applications there may be one device which
is especially important and whose ISR can take much longer than
normal. However eCos device drivers usually will not assume that they
are especially important, so their ISRs will be as short as possible.

          </P
><P
>An ISR is allowed to make very few kernel calls. It can manipulate the
interrupt mask, and on SMP systems it can use spinlocks. However an
ISR must not make higher-level kernel calls such as posting to a
semaphore, instead any such calls must be made from the DSR. This
avoids having to disable interrupts throughout the kernel and thus
improves interrupt latency.

run immediately. However if the interrupted thread was in the middle
of a kernel call and had locked the scheduler, then the DSR will be
deferred until the scheduler is again unlocked. This allows the
DSR to make certain kernel calls safely, for example posting to a
semaphore or signalling a condition variable. A DSR is a C function

>Controlling Interrupts</H2

>eCos provides two ways of controlling whether or not interrupts
happen. It is possible to disable and reenable all interrupts
globally, using <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_interrupt_disable</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_interrupt_enable</TT
>. Typically this works by
manipulating state inside the cpu itself, for example setting a flag
in a status register or executing special instructions. Alternatively
it may be possible to mask a specific interrupt source by writing to
one or to several interrupt mask registers. Hardware-specific
documentation should be consulted for the exact details of how
interrupt masking works, because a full implementation is not possible
on all hardware.
      </P
><P
>The primary use for these functions is to allow data to be shared
between ISRs and other code such as DSRs or threads. If both a thread
and an ISR need to manipulate either a data structure or the hardware
itself, there is a possible conflict if an interrupt happens just when
the thread is doing such manipulation. Problems can be avoided by the
thread either disabling or masking interrupts during the critical
region. If this critical region requires only a few instructions then
usually it is more efficient to disable interrupts. For larger
critical regions it may be more appropriate to use interrupt masking,
allowing other interrupts to occur. There are other uses for interrupt
masking. For example if a device is not currently being used by the
application then it may be desirable to mask all interrupts generated
by that device.
      </P

<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"

masking an interrupt is not an atomic operation, so if two threads
were to perform interrupt masking operations at the same time there
could be problems. <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"

all interrupts while it manipulates the interrupt mask. In situations
where interrupts are already know to be disabled,

specifies that a particular hardware interrupt should always be
handled on one specific processor in the system. In other words when
the interrupt triggers it is only that processor which detects it, and
it is only on that processor that the VSR and ISR will run. If a DSR

of code known as the VSR, or Vector Service Routine. By default this
code is provided by eCos. Usually it is written in assembler, but on
some architectures it may be possible to implement VSRs in C by
specifying an interrupt attribute. Compiler documentation should be
consulted for more information on this. The default eCos VSR will work
out which ISR function should process the interrupt, and set up a C
environment suitable for this ISR.
      </P
><P
>For some applications it may be desirable to replace the default eCos
VSR and handle some interrupts directly. This minimizes interrupt
latency, but it requires application developers to program at a lower
level. Usually the best way to write a custom VSR is to copy the
existing one supplied by eCos and then make appropriate modifications.
The function <TT

get hold of the current VSR for a given interrupt vector, allowing it
