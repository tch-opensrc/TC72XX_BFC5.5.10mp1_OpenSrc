>eCos has been designed to be fairly easy to port to new targets. A
target is a specific platform (board) using a given architecture (CPU
type). The porting is facilitated by the hierarchical layering of the
eCos sources - all architecture and platform specific code is
implemented in a HAL (hardware abstraction layer).</P
><P
>By porting the eCos HAL to a new target the core functionality of eCos
(infra, kernel, uITRON, etc) will be able to run on the target. It may
be necessary to add further platform specific code such as serial
drivers, display drivers, ethernet drivers, etc. to get a fully
capable system.</P
><P
>This document is intended as a help to the HAL porting process. Due to
the nature of a porting job, it is impossible to give a complete
description of what has to be done for each and every potential
target. This should not be considered a clear-cut recipe - you will
probably need to make some implementation decisions, tweak a few
things, and just plain have to rely on common sense.</P
><P
>However, what is covered here should be a large part of the
process. If you get stuck, you are advised to read the
<A
HREF="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/ml/ecos-discuss/"

>ecos-discuss archive</A

where you may find discussions which apply to the problem at
hand. You are also invited to ask questions on the
<A
HREF="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/ecos/intouch.html"
TARGET="_top"
>ecos-discuss mailing list</A
>
to help you resolve problems - but as is always the case
with community lists, do not consider it an oracle for any and all
questions. Use common sense - if you ask too many questions which
could have been answered by reading the

time allows. Feedback and help with improving the document is sought,

>At the moment this document is mostly an outline. There are many
details to fill in before it becomes complete. Many places you'll just
find a list of keywords / concepts that should be described (please
post on ecos-discuss if there are areas you think are not covered).</P

>All pages or sections where the caption ends in [TBD] contain little
more than key words and/or random thoughts - there has been no work
done as such on the content. The word FIXME may appear in the text to
highlight places where information is missing.</P
