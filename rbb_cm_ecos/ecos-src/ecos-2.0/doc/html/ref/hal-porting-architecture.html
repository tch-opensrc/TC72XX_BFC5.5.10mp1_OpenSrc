>The easiest way to make a new architecture HAL is simply to copy an
existing architecture HAL of an, if possible, closely matching
architecture and change all the files to match the new
architecture. The MIPS architecture HAL should be used if possible, as
it has the appropriate layout and coding conventions. Other HALs
may deviate from that norm in various ways.</P

compiler support as well as a few compiler features introduced during
eCos development - so compilers older than eCos may not provide these
features. Note that there is no C++ support for any 8 or 16 bit
CPUs. Before you can undertake an eCos port, you need the required
compiler support.</P

>The following gives a rough outline of the steps needed to create a
new architecture HAL. The exact order and set of steps needed will
vary greatly from architecture to architecture, so a lot of
flexibility is required. And of course, if the architecture HAL is to
be tested, it is necessary to do variant and  platform ports for the
initial target simultaneously.</P

the standard set of package directories.</P

>Copy the CDL file from an example HAL changing its name to match the
new HAL. Edit the file, changing option names as appropriate. Delete
any options that are specific to the original HAL, and and any new

be a continuing process during the development of the HAL. See <A
HREF="hal-porting-architecture.html#HAL-PORTING-ARCHITECTURE-CDL"
>the Section called <I
>CDL Requirements</I
></A
> for more details.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Copy the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>hal_arch.h</TT
> file from an example
HAL. Within this file you need to change or define the following:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Define the <SPAN
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>HAL_SavedRegisters</SPAN
> structure. This
may need to reflect the save order of any group register save/restore
instructions, the interrupt and exception save and restore formats,
and the procedure calling conventions. It may also need to cater for
optional FPUs and other functional units. It can be quite difficult to
develop a layout that copes with all requirements.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Define the bit manipulation routines,
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>HAL_LSBIT_INDEX()</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>HAL_MSBIT_INDEX()</TT
>. If the architecture contains
instructions to perform these, or related, operations, then these
should be defined as inline assembler fragments. Otherwise make them
calls to functions.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Define <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>HAL_THREAD_INIT_CONTEXT()</TT
>. This initializes
a restorable CPU context onto a stack pointer so that a later call to
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>HAL_THREAD_LOAD_CONTEXT()</TT
> or
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>HAL_THREAD_SWITCH_CONTEXT()</TT
> will execute it
correctly. This macro needs to take account of the same optional
features of the architecture as the definition of
<SPAN
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>HAL_SavedRegisters</SPAN
>.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Define <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>HAL_THREAD_LOAD_CONTEXT()</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>HAL_THREAD_SWITCH_CONTEXT()</TT
>. These should just be
calls to functions in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>context.S</TT
>.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Define <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>HAL_REORDER_BARRIER()</TT
>. This prevents code
being moved by the compiler and is necessary in some order-sensitive
code. This macro is actually defined identically in all architecture,
so it can just be copied.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Define breakpoint support. The macro
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>HAL_BREAKPOINT(label)</TT
> needs to be an inline assembly
fragment that invokes a breakpoint. The breakpoint instruction should
be labeled with the <TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"
><I
>label</I
></TT
>
argument. <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>HAL_BREAKINST</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>HAL_BREAKINST_SIZE</TT
> define the breakpoint
instruction for debugging purposes.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Define GDB support. GDB views the registers of the target as a linear
array, with each register having a well defined offset. This array may
differ from the ordering defined in
<SPAN
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>HAL_SavedRegisters</SPAN
>. The macros
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>HAL_GET_GDB_REGISTERS()</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>HAL_SET_GDB_REGISTERS()</TT
> translate between the GDB
array and the <SPAN
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>HAL_SavedRegisters</SPAN
> structure.
The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>HAL_THREAD_GET_SAVED_REGISTERS()</TT
> translates a
stack pointer saved by the context switch macros into a pointer to a
<SPAN
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>HAL_SavedRegisters</SPAN
> structure. Usually this is
a one-to-one translation, but this macro allows it to differ if
necessary.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Define long jump support. The type <SPAN
CLASS="TYPE"
>hal_jmp_buf</SPAN
> and the
functions <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>hal_setjmp()</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>hal_longjmp()</TT
> provide the underlying implementation
of the C library <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>setjmp()</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>longjmp()</TT
>.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Define idle thread action. Generally the macro
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>HAL_IDLE_THREAD_ACTION()</TT
> is defined to call a
function in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>hal_misc.c</TT
>.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Define stack sizes. The macros
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYGNUM_HAL_STACK_SIZE_MINIMUM</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYGNUM_HAL_STACK_SIZE_TYPICAL</TT
> should be defined to
the minimum size for any thread stack and a reasonable default for
most threads respectively. It is usually best to construct these out
of component sizes for the CPU save state and procedure call stack
usage. These definitions should not use anything other than numerical
values since they can be used from assembly code in some HALs.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Define memory access macros. These macros provide translation between
cached and uncached and physical memory spaces. They usually consist
of masking out bits of the supplied address and ORing in alternative
address bits.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Define global pointer save/restore macros. These really only need
defining if the calling conventions of the architecture require a
global pointer (as does the MIPS architecture), they may be empty
otherwise. If it is necessary to define these, then take a look at the
MIPS implementation for an example.</P
></LI
></UL
></LI
><LI
><P
>Copy <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>hal_intr.h</TT
> from an example HAL. Within this
file you should change or define the following:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Define the exception vectors. These should be detailed in the
architecture specification. Essentially for each exception entry point
defined by the architecture there should be an entry in the VSR
table. The offsets of these VSR table entries should be defined here
by <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYGNUM_HAL_VECTOR_*</TT
> definitions. The size of the
VSR table also needs to be defined here.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Map any hardware exceptions to standard names. There is a group of
exception vector name of the form
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYGNUM_HAL_EXCEPTION_*</TT
> that define a wide variety
of possible exceptions that many architectures raise. Generic code
detects whether the architecture can raise a given exception by
testing whether a given <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYGNUM_HAL_EXCEPTION_*</TT
>
definition is present. If it is present then its value is the vector
that raises that exception. This does not need to be a one-to-one
correspondence, and several <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYGNUM_HAL_EXCEPTION_*</TT
>
definitions may have the same value.</P
><P
>Interrupt vectors are usually defined in the variant or platform
HALs. The interrupt number space may either be continuous with the VSR
number space, where they share a vector table (as in the i386) or may
be a separate space where a separate decode stage is used (as in MIPS
or PowerPC).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Declare any static data used by the HAL to handle interrupts and
exceptions. This is usually three vectors for interrupts:
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>hal_interrupt_handlers[]</TT
>,
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>hal_interrupt_data[]</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>hal_interrupt_objects[]</TT
>, which are sized according
to the interrupt vector definitions. In addition a definition for the
VSR table, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>hal_vsr_table[]</TT
> should be made. These
vectors are normally defined in either <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>vectors.S</TT
>
or <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>hal_misc.c</TT
>.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Define interrupt enable/disable macros. These are normally inline
assembly fragments to execute the instructions, or manipulate the CPU
register, that contains the CPU interrupt enable bit.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>A feature that many HALs support is the ability to execute DSRs on the
interrupt stack. This is not an essential feature, and is better left
unimplemented in the initial porting effort. If this is required, then
the macro <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>HAL_INTERRUPT_STACK_CALL_PENDING_DSRS()</TT
>
should be defined to call a function in
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>vectors.S</TT
>.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Define the interrupt and VSR attachment macros. If the same arrays as
for other HALs have been used for VSR and interrupt vectors, then
these macro can be copied across unchanged.</P
></LI
></UL
></LI
><LI
><P
>A number of other header files also need to be filled in:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>basetype.h</TT
>. This file defines the basic types
used by eCos, together with the endianness and some other
characteristics. This file only really needs to contain definitions
if the architecture differs significantly from the defaults defined
in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>cyg_type.h</TT
></P
></LI
><LI
><P
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>hal_io.h</TT
>. This file contains macros for accessing
device IO registers. If the architecture uses memory mapped IO, then
these can be copied unchanged from an existing HAL such as MIPS. If
the architecture uses special IO instructions, then these macros must
be defined as inline assembler fragments. See the I386 HAL for an
example. PCI bus access macros are usually defined in the variant or
platform HALs.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>hal_cache.h</TT
>. This file contains cache access
macros. If the architecture defines cache instructions, or control
registers, then the access macros should be defined here. Otherwise
they must be defined in the variant or platform HAL. Usually the cache
dimensions (total size, line size, ways etc.) are defined in the
variant HAL.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>arch.inc</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>&lt;architecture&gt;.inc</TT
>. These files are
assembler headers used by <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>vectors.S</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>context.S</TT
>.
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>&lt;architecture&gt;.inc</TT
> is a general purpose
header that should contain things like register aliases, ABI
definitions and macros useful to general assembly
code. If there are no such definitions, then this file need not be
provided. <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>arch.inc</TT
> contains macros for performing
various eCos related operations such as initializing the CPU, caches,
FPU etc. The definitions here may often be configured or overridden by
definitions in the variant or platform HALs. See the MIPS HAL for an
example of this.</P
></LI
></UL
></LI
><LI
><P
>Write <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>vectors.S</TT
>. This is the most important file
in the HAL. It contains the CPU initialization code, exception and
interrupt handlers. While other HALs should be consulted for
structures and techniques, there is very little here that can be
copied over without major edits.</P
><P
>The main pieces of code that need to be defined here are:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Reset vector. This usually need to be positioned at the start of the
ROM or FLASH, so should be in a linker section of its own. It can then be
placed correctly by the linker script. Normally this code is little
more than a jump to the label <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>_start</TT
>.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Exception vectors. These are the trampoline routines connected to the
hardware exception entry points that vector through the VSR table. In
many architectures these are adjacent to the reset vector, and should
occupy the same linker section. If the architecture allow the vectors
to be moved then it may be necessary for these trampolines to be
position independent so they can be relocated at runtime.</P
><P
>The trampolines should do the minimum necessary to transfer control
from the hardware vector to the VSR pointed to by the matching table
entry. Exactly how this is done depends on the architecture. Usually
the trampoline needs to get some working registers by either saving
them to CPU special registers (e.g. PowerPC SPRs), using reserved
general registers (MIPS K0 and K1), using only memory based
operations (IA32), or just jumping directly (ARM). The VSR table index
to be used is either implicit in the entry point taken (PowerPC, IA32,
ARM), or must be determined from a CPU register (MIPS).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Write kernel startup code. This is the location the reset vector jumps
to, and can be in the main text section of the executable, rather than
a special section. The code here should first initialize the CPU and other
hardware subsystems. The best approach is to use a set of macro
calls that are defined either in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>arch.inc</TT
> or
overridden in the variant or platform HALs. Other jobs that this code
should do are: initialize stack pointer; copy the data section from
ROM to RAM if necessary; zero the BSS; call variant and platform
initializers; call <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_hal_invoke_constructors()</TT
>;
call <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>initialize_stub()</TT
> if necessary. Finally it
should call <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_start()</TT
>. See <A
HREF="hal-exception-handling.html#HAL-STARTUP"
>the Section called <I
>HAL Startup</I
> in Chapter 10</A
> for details.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Write the default exception VSR. This VSR is installed in the VSR
table for all synchronous exception vectors. See <A
HREF="hal-default-synchronous-exception-handling.html"

what this VSR does.</P

entries that correspond to external interrupts. See <A

> for details of
what this VSR does.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Write
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>hal_interrupt_stack_call_pending_dsrs()</TT
>. If this
function is defined in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>hal_arch.h</TT
> then it should
appear here. The purpose of this function is to call DSRs on the
interrupt stack rather than the current thread's stack. This is not an
essential feature, and may be left until later. However it interacts
with the stack switching that goes on in the interrupt VSR, so it may
make sense to write these pieces of code at the same time to ensure
consistency.</P
><P
>When this function is implemented it should do the following:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Take a copy of the current SP and then switch to the interrupt stack.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Save the old SP, together with the CPU status register (or whatever
register contains the interrupt enable status) and any other
registers that may be corrupted by a function call (such as any link
register) to locations in the interrupt stack.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Enable interrupts.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Call <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_interrupt_call_pending_DSRs()</TT
>. This is a
kernel functions that actually calls any pending DSRs.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Retrieve saved registers from the interrupt stack and switch back to
the current thread stack.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Merge the interrupt enable state recorded in the save CPU status
register with the current value of the status register to restore the
previous enable state. If the status register does not contain any
other persistent state then this can be a simple restore of the
register. However if the register contains other state bits that might
have been changed by a DSR, then care must be taken not to disturb
these.</P
></LI
></UL
></LI
><LI
><P
>Define any data items needed. Typically <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>vectors.S</TT

may contain definitions for the VSR table, the interrupt tables and the

>Write <TT

><TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>hal_interrupt_*[]</TT

defined here.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_hal_exception_handler()</TT
>. This function is
called from the exception VSR. It usually does extra decoding of the
exception and invokes any special handlers for things like FPU traps,
bus errors or memory exceptions. If there is nothing special to be
done for an exception, then it either calls into the GDB stubs, by
calling <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>__handle_exception()</TT
>, or
invokes the kernel by calling
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_hal_deliver_exception()</TT
>.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>hal_arch_default_isr()</TT

<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>hal_interrupt_handlers[]</TT
> array is usually
initialized with pointers to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>hal_default_isr()</TT
>,
which is defined in the common HAL. This function handles things like
Ctrl-C processing, but if that is not relevant, then it will call
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>hal_arch_default_isr()</TT
>. Normally this function
should just return zero.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_hal_invoke_constructors()</TT
>. This calls the
constructors for all static objects before the program starts. eCos
relies on these being called in the correct order for it to function
correctly. The exact way in which constructors are handled may differ
between architectures, although most use a simple table of function
pointers between labels <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>__CTOR_LIST__</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>__CTOR_END__</TT
> which must called in order from the
top down. Generally, this function can be copied directly from an
existing architecture HAL.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Bit indexing functions. If the macros
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>HAL_LSBIT_INDEX()</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>HAL_MSBIT_INDEX()</TT
> are defined as function calls,
then the functions should appear here. The main reason for doing this
is that the architecture does not have support for bit indexing and
these functions must provide the functionality by conventional
means. While the trivial implementation is a simple for loop, it is
expensive and non-deterministic. Better, constant time,
implementations can be found in several HALs (MIPS for example).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>hal_delay_us()</TT
>. If the macro
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>HAL_DELAY_US()</TT
> is defined in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>hal_intr.h</TT
> then it should be defined to
call this function. While most of the time this function is called
with very small values, occasionally (particularly in some ethernet
drivers) it is called with values of several seconds. Hence the
function should take care to avoid overflow in any calculations.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>hal_idle_thread_action()</TT
>. This function is called
from the idle thread via the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>HAL_IDLE_THREAD_ACTION()</TT
> macro, if so
defined. While normally this function does nothing, during development
this is often a good place to report various important system
parameters on LCDs, LED or other displays. This function can also
monitor system state and report any anomalies. If the architecture
supports a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>halt</TT
> instruction then this is a good
place to put an inline assembly fragment to execute it. It is also a
good place to handle any power saving activity.</P

needs to be done. The only complex part is the support for
single-stepping. This is used a lot by GDB, so it cannot be
avoided. If the architecture has support for a trace or single-step
trap then that can be used for this purpose. If it does not then this
must be simulated by planting a breakpoint in the next
instruction. This can be quite involved since it requires some
analysis of the current instruction plus the state of the CPU to
determine where execution is going to go next.</P

support for different variants, use of FPUs, MMUs and caches. The
exact split between the architecture, variant and platform HALs for
various features is also somewhat fluid. </P
