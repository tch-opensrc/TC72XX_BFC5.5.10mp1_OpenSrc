>The CPU delivers all  exceptions, whether
synchronous faults or asynchronous interrupts, to a set of hardware
defined vectors. Depending on the architecture, these may be
implemented in a number of different ways. Examples of existing
mechanisms are:</P

><DIV
CLASS="VARIABLELIST"

><DD
><P
>      Exceptions are vectored to locations 256 bytes apart starting at
      either zero or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>0xFFF00000</TT
>. There are 16 such
      vectors defined by the basic architecture and extra vectors may
      be defined by specific variants. One of the base vectors is for
      all external interrupts, and another is for the architecture
      defined timer.
      </P
></DD
><DT
>MIPS</DT
><DD
><P
>      Most exceptions and all interrupts are vectored to a single
      address at either <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>0x80000000</TT
> or
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>0xBFC00180</TT
>. Software is responsible for
      reading the exception code from the CPU <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>cause</TT
>
      register to discover its true source. Some TLB and debug
      exceptions are delivered to different vector addresses, but
      these are not used currently by eCos. One of the exception codes
      in the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>cause</TT
> register indicates an external
      interrupt. Additional bits in the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>cause</TT
>
      register provide a first-level decode for the interrupt source,
      one of which represents an architecture defined timer.
      </P
></DD
><DT
>IA32</DT

><P
>      Exceptions are delivered via an Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)
      which is essentially an indirection table indexed by exception
      number. The IDT may be placed anywhere in memory. In PC hardware
      the standard interrupt controller can be programmed to deliver
      the external interrupts to a block of 16 vectors at any offset
      in the IDT. There is no hardware supplied mechanism for
      determining the vector taken, other than from the address jumped
      to.

><P
>      All exceptions, including the FIQ and IRQ interrupts, are
      vectored to locations four bytes apart starting at zero. There
      is only room for one instruction here, which must immediately
      jump out to handling code higher in memory. Interrupt sources
      have to be decoded entirely from the interrupt controller.
      </P

><P
>With such a wide variety of hardware approaches, it is not possible to
provide a generic mechanism for the substitution of exception vectors
directly. Therefore, eCos translates all of these mechanisms in to a
common approach that can be used by portable code on all platforms.</P
><P
>The mechanism implemented is to attach to each hardware vector a short
piece of trampoline code that makes an indirect jump via a table to
the actual handler for the exception. This handler is called the
Vector Service Routine (VSR) and the table is called the VSR table.</P
><P
>The trampoline code performs the absolute minimum processing necessary
to identify the exception source, and jump to the VSR. The VSR is then
responsible for saving the CPU state and taking the necessary actions
to handle the exception or interrupt. The entry conditions for the VSR
are as close to the raw hardware exception entry state as possible -
although on some platforms the trampoline will have had to move or
reorganize some registers to do its job.</P
><P
>To make this more concrete, consider how the trampoline code operates
in each of the architectures described above:</P
><P
></P
><DIV
CLASS="VARIABLELIST"
><DL
><DT
>PowerPC</DT
><DD
><P
>      A separate trampoline is contained in each of the vector
      locations. This code saves a few work registers away to the
      special purposes registers available, loads the exception number
      into a register and then uses that to index the VSR table and
      jump to the VSR. The VSR is entered with some registers move to
      the SPRs, and one of the data register containing the number of
      the vector taken.
      </P
></DD
><DT
>MIPS</DT
><DD
><P
>      A single trampoline routine attached to the common vector reads
      the exception code out of the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>cause</TT
> register
      and uses that value to index the VSR table and jump to the VSR.
      The trampoline uses the two registers defined in the ABI for
      kernel use to do this, one of these will contain the exception
      vector number for the VSR.
      </P
></DD
><DT
>IA32</DT
><DD
><P
>      There is a separate 3 or 4 instruction trampoline pointed to by
      each active IDT table entry. The trampoline for exceptions that
      also have an error code pop it from the stack and put it into a
      memory location. Trampolines for non-error-code exceptions just
      zero the memory location. Then all trampolines push an
      interrupt/exception number onto the stack, and take an indirect
      jump through a precalculated offset in the VSR table. This is
      all done without saving any registers, using memory-only
      operations. The VSR is entered with the vector number pushed
      onto the stack on top of the standard hardware saved state.
      </P
></DD
><DT
>ARM</DT
><DD
><P
>      The trampoline consists solely of the single instruction at the
      exception entry point. This is an indirect jump via a location
      32 bytes higher in memory. These locations, from
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>0x20</TT
> up, form the VSR table. Since each VSR
      is entered in a different CPU mode
      (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SVC,UNDEF,ABORT,IRQ or FIQ</TT
>) there has to be a
      different VSR for each exception that knows how to save the CPU
      state correctly.
