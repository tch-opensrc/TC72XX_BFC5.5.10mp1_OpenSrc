>Some eCos platforms have supported full debugging capabilities via
CygMon since day one. Platforms of the architectures PowerPC, ARM, and
SH do not provide those features unless a GDB stub is included in the
application.</P
><P
>This is going to change. All platforms will (eventually) support
all the debugging features by relying on a ROM/RAM calling interface
(also referred to as virtual vector table) provided by the ROM
monitor. This calling interface is based on the tables used by libbsp
and is thus backwards compatible with the existing CygMon supported
platforms.</P

>What are virtual vectors, what do they do, and why are they
needed?</P
><P
>"Virtual vectors" is the name of a table located at a static
location in the target address space. This table contains 64 vectors
that point to <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>service</I
></SPAN
> functions or data.</P
><P
>The fact that the vectors are always placed at the same location in
the address space means that both ROM and RAM startup configurations
can access these and thus the services pointed to.</P
><P
>The primary goal is to allow services to be provided by ROM
configurations (ROM monitors such as RedBoot in particular) with
<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>clients</I
></SPAN
> in RAM configurations being able to use these
services.</P
><P
>Without the table of pointers this would be impossible since the
ROM and RAM applications would be linked separately - in effect having
separate name spaces - preventing direct references from one to the
other.</P
><P
>This decoupling of service from client is needed by RedBoot,
allowing among other things debugging of applications which do not
contain debugging client code (stubs).</P

NAME="AEN8971">Initialization (or Mechanism vs. Policy)</H3
><P
>Virtual vectors are a <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>mechanism</I
></SPAN
> for decoupling services
from clients in the address space.</P
><P
>The mechanism allows services to be implemented by a ROM
monitor, a RAM application, to be switched out at run-time, to be
disabled by installing pointers to dummy functions, etc.</P
><P
>The appropriate use of the mechanism is specified loosely by a
<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>policy</I
></SPAN
>. The general policy dictates that the vectors are
initialized in whole by ROM monitors (built for ROM or RAM), or by
stand-alone applications.</P
><P
>For configurations relying on a ROM monitor environment, the policy
is to allow initialization on a service by service basis. The default
is to initialize all services, except COMMS services since these are
presumed to already be carrying a communication session to the
debugger / console which was used for launching the application.  This
means that the bulk of the code gets tested in normal builds, and not
just once in a blue moon when building new stubs or a ROM
configuration.</P
><P
>The configuration options are written to comply with this policy by
default, but can be overridden by the user if desired. Defaults
are:</P

><LI

debugging and diagnostic IO services, the RAM application relies
on these by default.</P

NAME="AEN8985">Pros and Cons of Virtual Vectors</H3
><P
>There are pros and cons associated with the use of virtual
vectors. We do believe that the pros generally outweigh the cons by a
great margin, but there may be situations where the opposite is
true.</P
><P
>The use of the services are implemented by way of macros, meaning
that it is possible to circumvent the virtual vectors if
desired. There is (as yet) no implementation for doing this, but it is
possible.</P
><P
>Here is a list of pros and cons:</P
><P
></P
><DIV
CLASS="VARIABLELIST"
><DL
><DT
>Pro: Allows debugging without including stubs</DT
><DD
><P
>This is the primary reason for using virtual vectors. It
          allows the ROM monitor to provide most of the debugging
          infrastructure, requiring only the application to provide
          hooks for asynchronous debugger interrupts and for accessing
          kernel thread information.</P
></DD
><DT
>Pro: Allows debugging to be initiated from arbitrary
       channel</DT
><DD
><P
> While this is only true where the application does not
           actively override the debugging channel setup, it is a very
           nice feature during development. In particular it makes it
           possible to launch (and/or debug) applications via Ethernet
           even though the application configuration does not contain
           networking support.</P
></DD
><DT
>Pro: Image smaller due to services being provided by ROM
       monitor</DT
><DD
><P
>All service functions except HAL IO are included in the
           default configuration. But if these are all disabled the
           image for download will be a little smaller. Probably
           doesn't matter much for regular development, but it is a
           worthwhile saving for the 20000 daily tests run in the Red
           Hat eCos test farm.</P
></DD
><DT
>Con: The vectors add a layer of indirection, increasing application
       size and reducing performance.</DT
><DD
><P
>The size increase is a fraction of what is required to
           implement the services. So for RAM configurations there is
           a net saving, while for ROM configurations there is a small
           overhead.</P
><P
>The performance loss means little for most of the
           services (of which the most commonly used is diagnostic IO
           which happens via polled routines
           anyway).</P
></DD
><DT
>Con: The layer of indirection is another point of
       failure.</DT
><DD
><P
> The concern primarily being that of vectors being
           trashed by rogue writes from bad code, causing a complete
           loss of the service and possibly a crash.  But this does
           not differ much from a rogue write to anywhere else in the
           address space which could cause the same amount of
           mayhem. But it is arguably an additional point of failure
           for the service in question.</P
></DD
><DT
>Con: All the indirection stuff makes it harder to bring a HAL
       up</DT
><DD
><P
> This is a valid concern. However, seeing as most of the
           code in question is shared between all HALs and should
           remain unchanged over time, the risk of it being broken
           when a new HAL is being worked on should be
           minimal.</P
><P
> When starting a new port, be sure to implement the HAL
           IO drivers according to the scheme used in other drivers,
           and there should be no problem.</P
><P
> However, it is still possible to circumvent the vectors
           if they are suspect of causing problems: simply change the
           HAL_DIAG_INIT and HAL_DIAG_WRITE_CHAR macros to use the raw
           IO functions.</P

development for debugging, assertion and possibly tracing
messages. All proper IO should happen via proper devices. This means
it should be possible to remove the HAL device drivers from production
configurations where assertions are disabled.</P
><P
>The debugging channel is used for communication between the
debugger and the stub which remotely controls the target for the
debugger (the stub runs on the target). This usually happens via some
protocol, encoding commands and replies in some suitable form.</P

raw ASCII from the target on the same channel will either result in
protocol errors (with loss of control over the target) or the text may
just be ignored as junk by the debugger.</P
><P
>To get around this, some debuggers have a special command for text
output. Mangling is the process of encoding diagnostic ASCII text
output in the form specified by the debugger protocol.</P
><P
>When it is necessary to use mangling, i.e. when writing console
output to the same port used for debugging, a mangler function is
installed on the console channel which mangles the text and passes it
on to the debugger channel.</P

NAME="AEN9086">Footnote: Design Reasoning for Control of Console Channel</H3
><P
>The current code for controlling the console channel is a
replacement for an older implementation which had some shortcomings
which addressed by the new implementation.</P
><P
>This is what the old implementation did: on initialization it would
check if the CDL configured console channel differed from the active
debug channel - and if so, set the console channel, thereby disabling
mangling.</P
><P
>The idea was that whatever channel was configured to be used for
console (i.e., diagnostic output) in the application was what should
be used. Also, it meant that if debug and console channels were
normally the same, a changed console channel would imply a request for
unmangled output.</P

><P
></P

><LI
><P
> It was impossible to inherit the existing connection by which
     the application was launched (either by RedBoot commands via
     telnet, or by via a debugger).</P
><P
>This was mostly a problem on targets supporting Ethernet
     access since the diagnostic output would not be returned via the
     Ethernet connection, but on the configured serial port.</P
><P
>The problem also occurred on any targets with multiple serial
     ports where the ROM monitor was configured to use a different
     port than the CDL defaults.</P

> Proper control of when to mangle or just write out raw ASCII
        text.</P

     channel specified is the same as that used for debugging. This
     usually happens if GDB is used to download the application, but
     direct interaction with the application on the same channel is
     desired (GDB protocol only allows output from the target, no

means that when you use diag_printf (or the libc printf function) the
stream goes through the selected console procedure table. If you use

which the diagnostics output goes to at run-time.</P

(regardless of the <TT

the ROM monitor provides the services). Here is a small example which
changes the console to use channel 2, fetches the comm procs pointer
and calls the write function from that table, then restores the
console to the original channel:</P

NAME="AEN9325">Implementation Details</H3
><P
>There is an array of procedure tables (raw comm channels) for each
IO device of the platform which get initialized by the ROM monitor, or
optionally by a RAM startup configuration (allowing the RAM
configuration to take full control of the target).  In addition to
this, there's a special table which is used to hold mangler
procedures.</P
><P
>The vector table defines which of these channels are selected for
console and debugging IO respectively: console entry can be empty,
point to mangler channel, or point to a raw channel. The debugger
entry should always point to a raw channel.</P
><P
>During normal console output (i.e., diagnostic output) the console
table will be used to handle IO if defined. If not defined, the debug
table will be used.</P
><P
>This means that debuggers (such as GDB) which require text streams
to be mangled (O-packetized in the case of GDB), can rely on the ROM
monitor install mangling IO routines in the special mangler table and
select this for console output. The mangler will pass the mangled data
on to the selected debugging channel.</P
><P
>If the eCos configuration specifies a different console channel
from that used by the debugger, the console entry will point to the
selected raw channel, thus overriding any mangler provided by the ROM
monitor.</P
><P
>See hal_if_diag_* routines in hal_if.c for more details of the stream
path of diagnostic output. See <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_hal_gdb_diag_*()</TT
> routines in
<TT
