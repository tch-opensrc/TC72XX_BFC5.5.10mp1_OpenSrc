>The package allows the CPU load to be estimated. The measurement code
must first be calibrated to the target it is running on. Once this
has been performed the measurement process can be started. This is a
continuous process, so always providing the most up to data
measurements. The process can be stopped at any time if required. Once
the process is active, the results can be retrieved.</P
><P
>Note that if the target/processor performs any power saving actions,
such as reducing the clock speed, or halting until the next interrupt
etc, these will interfere with the CPU load measurement. Under these
conditions the measurement results are undefined. The synthetic target
is one such system. See the implementation details at the foot of this
page for further information.  </P

><P
>This section gives a few details of how the measurements are
made. This should help to understand what the results mean.</P
><P
>When there are no other threads runnable, eCos will execute the idle
thread. This thread is always runnable and uses the lowest thread
priority. The idle thread does little. It is an endless loop which
increments the variable, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>idle_thread_loops</TT
> and
executes the macro <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>HAL_IDLE_THREAD_ACTION</TT
>. The cpu
load measurement code makes use of the variable. It periodically
examines the value of the variable and sees how much it has
changed. The idler the system, the more it will have incremented. From
this it is simple to determine the load of the system.</P
><P
>The function <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>cyg_cpuload_calibrate</TT
> executes the
idle thread for 100ms to determine how much
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>idle_thread_loops</TT
> is incremented on a system idle
for 100ms. <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>cyg_cpuload_create</TT
> starts an alarm which
every 100ms calls an alarm function. This function looks at the
difference in <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>idle_thread_loops</TT
> since the last
invocation of the alarm function and so calculated how idle or busy
the system has been. The structure <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>cyg_cpuload</TT
> is
updated during the alarm functions with the new results.  The 100ms
result is simply the result from the last measurement period. A simple
filter is used to average the load over a period of time, namely 1s
and 10s. Due to rounding errors, the 1s and 10s value will probably
never reach 100% on a fully loaded system, but 99% is often seen.</P
><P
>As stated above, clever power management code will interfere with
these measurements. The basic assumption is that the idle thread will
be executed un-hindered and under the same conditions as when the
calibration function was executed. If the CPU clock rate is reduced,
the idle thread counter will be incremented less and so the CPU load
measurements will give values too high. If the CPU is halted entirely,
100% cpu load will be measured.</P
