>Some <SPAN

configuration options. There are two main types of consequences.
Typically enabling a configuration option results in one or more
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>#define's</TT
> in a configuration header file, and
properties that affect this include <SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>define</SPAN
>, <SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>define_proc</SPAN
> and
<SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>no_define</SPAN
>. Enabling a configuration option can also affect the build
process, primarily determining which files get built and added to the
appropriate library. Properties related to the build process include
<SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>compile</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>make</SPAN
>. This chapter describes the whole build process,
including details such as compiler flags and custom build steps.</P
><P
>Part of the overall design of the <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>eCos</SPAN
> component framework is that
it can interact with a number of different build systems. The most
obvious of these is <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>GNU
make</SPAN
>:the component framework can generate one or more
makefiles, and the user can then build the various packages simply by
invoking <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>make</SPAN
>. However it
should also be possible to build <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>eCos</SPAN
> by other means: the
component framework can be queried about what is involved in building
a given configuration, and this information can then be fed into the
desired build system. Component writers should be aware of this
possibility. Most packages will not be affected because the <SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>compile</SPAN
>
property can be used to provide all the required information, but care
has to be taken when writing custom build steps.</P

>It is necessary to create an <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>eCos</SPAN
> configuration before anything can
be built. With some tools such as the graphical configuration tool
this configuration will be created in memory, and it is not essential
to produce an <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ecos.ecc</TT
> savefile first (although
it is still very desirable to generate such a savefile at some point,
to allow the configuration to be re-loaded later on). With other tools
the savefile is generated first, for example using
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ecosconfig&nbsp;new</TT
>, and then a build tree is
generated using <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ecosconfig&nbsp;tree</TT
>. The savefile
contains all the information needed to recreate a configuration.</P
><P
>An <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>eCos</SPAN
> build actually involves three separate trees. The component
repository acts as the source tree, and for application developers
this should be considered a read-only resource. The build tree is
where all intermediate files, especially object files, are created.
The install tree is where the main library
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>libtarget.a</TT
>, the exported header files, and
similar files end up. Following a successful build it is possible to
take just the install tree and use it for developing an application:
none of the files in the component repository or the build tree are
needed for that. The build tree will be needed again only if the user
changes the configuration. However the install tree does not contain
copies of all of the documentation for the various packages, instead
the documentation is kept only in the component repository.</P
><P
>By default the build tree, the install tree, and the
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ecos.ecc</TT
> savefile all reside in the same
directory tree. This is not a requirement, both the install tree and
the savefile can be anywhere in the file system.</P
><P
>It is worth noting that the component framework does not separate the
usual <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>make</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>make&nbsp;install</TT
>
stages. A build always populates the install tree, and any
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>make&nbsp;install</TT
> step would be redundant.</P
><P
>The install tree will always begin with two directories, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>include</TT
> for the exported header files and
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>lib</TT
> for the main library
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>libtarget.a</TT
> and other files
such as the linker script. In addition there will be a subdirectory
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>include/pkgconf</TT
> containing the
configuration header files, which are generated or updated at the same
time the build tree is created or updated. More details of header file
generation are given below. Additional <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>include</TT
> subdirectories such as <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>sys</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>cyg/kernel</TT
> will be created during the
first build, when each package's exported header files are copied to
the install tree. The install tree may also end up with additional
subdirectories during a build, for example as a result of custom build
steps. </P
><P
>The component framework does not define the structure of the build
tree, and this may vary between build systems. It can be assumed that
each package in the configuration will have its own directory in the
build tree, and that this directory will be used for storing the
package's object files and as the current directory for any build
steps for that package. This avoids problems when custom build steps
from different packages generate intermediate files which happen to
have the same name.</P
><P
>Some build systems may allow application developers to copy a source
file from the component repository to the build tree and edit the
copy. This allows users to experiment with small changes, for example
to add a couple of lines of debugging to a package, without having to
modify the master copy in the component repository which could be
shared by several projects or several people. Functionality such as
this is transparent to component writers, and it is the responsibility
of the build system to make sure that the right thing happens.</P

CLASS="NOTE"

CLASS="NOTE"

><B
>Note: </B
>There are some unresolved issues related to the build tree and install
tree. Specifically, when updating an existing build or install tree,
what should happen to unexpected files or directories? Suppose the
user started with a configuration that included the math library, and
the install tree contains header files <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>include/math.h</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>include/sys/ieeefp.h</TT
>. The user then removed
the math library from the configuration and is updating the build
tree. It is now desirable to remove these header files from the
install tree, so that if any application code still attempts to use
the math library this will fail at compile time rather than at link
time. There will also be some object files in the existing
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>libtarget.a</TT
> library which are no longer
appropriate, and there may be other files in the install tree as a
result of custom build steps. The build tree will still contain a
directory for the math library, which no longer serves any purpose.</P
><P
>However, it is also possible that some of the files in the build tree
or the install tree were placed there by the user, in which case
removing them automatically would be a bad idea.</P
><P
>At present the component framework does not keep track of exactly what
should be present in the build and install trees, so it cannot readily
determine which files or library members are obsolete and can safely
be removed, and which ones are unexpected and need to be reported to
the user. This will be addressed in a future release of the system.</P
