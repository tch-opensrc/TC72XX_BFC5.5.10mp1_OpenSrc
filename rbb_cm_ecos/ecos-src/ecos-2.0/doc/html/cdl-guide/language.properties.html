>Each package, component, option, and interface has a body of
properties, which provide the component framework with information
about how to handle each option. For example there is a property for a
descriptive text message which can be displayed to a user who is
trying to figure out just what effect manipulating the option would
have on the target application. There is another property for the
default value, for example whether a particular option should be
enabled or disabled by default.</P
><P
>All of the properties are optional, it is legal to define a
configuration option which has an empty body. However some properties
are more optional than others: users will not appreciate having to
manipulate an option if they are not given any sort of description or
documentation. Other properties are intended only for very specific
purposes, for example <SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>make_object</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>include_files</SPAN
>, and are used
only rarely.</P
><P
>Because different properties serve very different purposes, their
syntax is not as uniform as the top-level commands. Some properties
take no arguments at all. Other properties take a single argument such
as a description string, or a list of arguments such as a <SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>compile</SPAN
>
property which specifies the file or files that should be compiled if
a given option is active and enabled. The <SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>define_proc</SPAN
> property takes
as argument a snippet of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Tcl</SPAN
> code. The <SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>active_if</SPAN
>, <SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>calculated</SPAN
>,
<SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>default_value</SPAN
>, <SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>legal_values</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>requires</SPAN
> properties take various
expressions. Additional properties may be defined in future which take
new kinds of arguments.</P
><P
>All property parsing code supports options for every property,
although at present the majority of properties do not yet take any
options. Any initial arguments that begin with a hyphen character
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>-</TT
> will be interpreted as an option, for example:</P

syntax errors when the <SPAN

the string <TT

></TABLE
><P
>The property parsing code involves a recursive invocation of the Tcl
interpreter that is used to parse the top-level commands. This means
that some characters in the body of an option will be treated
specially. The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>#</TT
> character can be used for
comments. The backslash character <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>\</TT

dollar character <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

<TT

>, and the quote character
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>"</TT

time this is not a problem because these characters are not useful for
most properties. On occasion having a <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Tcl</SPAN
> interpreter around
performing the parser can be very powerful. For more details of
how the presence of a <SPAN

>Users can only be expected to manipulate configuration options
sensibly if they are given sufficient information about these options.
There are three properties which serve to explain an option in plain
text: the <A
HREF="ref.display.html"
><SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>display</SPAN
></A
> property gives
a textual alias for an option, which is usually more comprehensible
than something like <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYGPKG_LIBC_TIME_ZONES`</TT
>; the
<A
HREF="ref.description.html"
><SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>description</SPAN
></A
> property gives a
longer description, typically a paragraph or so; the <A
HREF="ref.doc.html"
><SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>doc</SPAN
></A
> property specifies the location of
additional on-line documentation related to a configuration option. In
the context of a graphical tool the <SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>display</SPAN
> string will be the
primary way for users to identify configuration options; the
<SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>description</SPAN

selected; the on-line documentation will only be accessed when the
user explicitly requests it.</P

><P
>In the context of configurability, the concept of an option's value is
somewhat non-trivial. First an option may or may not be loaded: it is
possible to build a configuration which has the math library but not
the kernel; however the math library's <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>CDL</SPAN
> scripts still reference
kernel options, for example
<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGSEM_LIBM_THREAD_SAFE_COMPAT_MODE</TT
> has a
<SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>requires</SPAN
> constraint on
<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGVAR_KERNEL_THREADS_DATA</TT
>. Even if an option is
loaded it may or may not be active, depending on what is happening
higher up in the hierarchy: if the C library's
<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGPKG_LIBC_STDIO</TT
> component is disabled then some
other options such as <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGNUM_LIBC_STDIO_BUFSIZE</TT
>
become irrelevant. In addition each option has both a boolean
enabled/disabled flag and a data part. For many options only the
boolean flag is of interest, while for others only the data part is of
interest. The <SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>flavor</SPAN
> property can be used to control this:</P

><DIV
CLASS="VARIABLELIST"

><P
>This flavor indicates that neither the boolean nor the data parts are
user-modifiable: the option is always enabled and the data is always
set to <TT

various options to be grouped below it.</P

><P
>The <SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"

user-modifiable, but which instead are fixed by the target hardware or

avoided since it complicates application development: instead of just

exported to the <TT

>install/include</TT

directory. This is the desired behavior for some packages like the C
library, since headers like <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>stdio.h</TT

However if all header files were to end up in that directory then
there would be a significant risk of a name clash. Instead it is
better for packages to specify some sub-directory for their exported
header files, for example:</P

><P
>For packages which follow the <A

component framework will assume that the package's
<TT

all exported header files. If this is not the case, for example
because the package is sufficiently simple that the layout convention
