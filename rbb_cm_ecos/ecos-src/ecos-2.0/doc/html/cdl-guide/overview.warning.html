>Large parts of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>eCos</SPAN
> were developed concurrently with the development
of the configuration technology, or in some cases before design work
on that technology was complete. As a consequence the various <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>eCos</SPAN
>
packages often make only limited use of the available functionality.
This situation is expected to change over time. It does mean that many
of the descriptions in this guide will not correspond exactly to how
the <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>eCos</SPAN
> packages work right now, but rather to how they could work.
Some of the more extreme discrepancies such as the location of on-line
documentation in the component repository will be mentioned in the
appropriate places in the guide.</P
><P
>A consequence of this is that developers of new components can look at
existing <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>CDL</SPAN
> scripts for examples, and discover discrepancies
between what is recommended in this guide and what actually happens at
present. In such cases this guide should be treated as authoritative.</P
><P
>It is also worth noting that the current component framework is not
finished. Various parts of this guide will refer to possible changes
and enhancements in future versions. Examining the source code of the
configuration tools may reveal hints about other likely developments,
and there are many more possible enhancements which only exist at a
conceptual level right now.</P
