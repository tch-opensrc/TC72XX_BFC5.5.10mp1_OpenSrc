NAME="LANGUAGE.NAMING">Option Naming Convention</H1
><P
>All the options in a given configuration live in the same namespace.
Furthermore it is not possible for two separate options to have the
same name, because this would make any references to those options in
<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>CDL</SPAN
> expressions ambiguous. A naming convention exists to avoid
problems. It is recommended that component writers observe some or all
of this convention to reduce the probability of name clashes with
other packages.</P
><P
>There is an important restriction on option names. Typically the
component framework will output a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>#define</TT
> for every
active and enabled option, using the name as the symbol being defined.
This requires that all names are valid C preprocessor symbols, a
limitation that is enforced even for options which have the
<SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>no_define</SPAN
> property. Preprocessor symbols can be any sequence of
lower case letters <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>a</TT
>-<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>z</TT
>, upper
case letters, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>A</TT
>-<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>Z</TT
>, the
underscore character <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>_</TT
>, and the digits
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>0</TT
>-<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>9</TT
>. The first character must be
a non-digit. Using an underscore as the first character is
discouraged, because that may clash with reserved language
identifiers. In addition there is a convention that preprocessor
symbols only use upper case letters, and some component writers may
wish to follow this convention.</P
><P
>A typical option name could be something like
<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGSEM_KERNEL_SCHED_BITMAP</TT
>. This name consists of
several different parts:</P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>The first few characters, in this case the three letters
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYG</TT
>, are used to identify the organization that
produced the package. For historical reasons packages produced by Red
Hat tend to use the prefix <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYG</TT
> rather than
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>RHAT</TT
>. Component writers should use their own
prefix: even when cutting and pasting from an existing <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>CDL</SPAN
> script
the prefix should be changed to something appropriate to their
organization. </P
><P
>It can be argued that a short prefix, often limited to upper case
letters, is not sufficiently long to eliminate the possibility of
name clashes. A longer prefix could be used, for example one based on
internet domain names. However the C preprocessor has no concept of
namespaces or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>import</TT
> directives, so it would always
be necessary to use the full option name in component source code
which gets tedious - option names tend to be long enough as it is.
There is a small increased risk of name clashes, but this risk is felt
to be acceptable.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The next three characters indicate the nature of the option, for
example whether it affects the interface or just the implementation. A
list of common tags is given below.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>KERNEL_SCHED</TT
> part indicates the location of the
option within the overall hierarchy. In this case the option is part of
the scheduling component of the kernel package. Having the hierarchy
details as part of the option name can help in understanding
configurable code and further reduces the probability of a name clash.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The final part, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>BITMAP</TT
>, identifies the option
itself. </P
></LI
></OL
><P
>The three-character tag is intended to provide some additional
information about the nature of the option. There are a number of
pre-defined tags. However for many options there is a choice:
options related to the platform should normally use
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>HWR</TT
>, but numerical options should normally use
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NUM</TT
>; a platform-related numerical option such as
the size of an interrupt stack could therefore use either tag.
There are no absolute rules, and it is left to component writers to
interpret the following guidelines:</P

to the processor architecture. Typically such options will only occur
in architectural or variant HAL packages.</P

platform HAL packages.</P

>This tag is intended for packages or components, in other words
options which extend the configuration hierarchy. Arguably a
<TT

components, but this could be confusing because of the considerable
number of computing terms that begin with com.</P

some way related to debugging, for example it may enable assertions in
some part of the system.</P
></DD

CLASS="LITERAL"
>xxxTST_</TT

affect actual application code, instead they control the interaction
between target-side test cases and a host-side testing infrastructure.</P
></DD
><DT
><TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>xxxFUN_</TT

package. There are a number of related tag which are also
interface-related. <TT

for options that control whether or not one or more functions are
provided by the package, but can also be used if none of the other
interface-related tags is applicable.</P
></DD

absence of an entire class.</P

CLASS="LITERAL"
>xxxMFN_</TT

>xxxSEM_</TT

><DD
><P
>A <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SEM</TT

does affect the interface, this is incidental). Instead it is used for
options which have a fundamental effect on the semantic behavior of a
package. For example the choice of kernel schedulers is semantic in
nature: it does not affect the interface, in particular the function
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_thread_create</TT

scheduler has been selected. However it does have a major impact on
the system's behavior.</P
></DD

><TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

><DD
><P
><TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>IMP</TT

affect either the interface or the semantic behavior (with the
possible exception of timing-related changes). A typical
implementation option controls whether or not a particular function or
set of functions should get inlined.</P

></DD
></DL
></DIV
><P
>There is one special case of a potential name clash that is worth
mentioning here. When the component framework generates a
configuration header file for a given package, by default it will use
a name derived from the package name (the <SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>define_header</SPAN
> property can
be used to override this). The file name is constructed from the
package name by removing everything up to and including the first
underscore, converting the remainder of the name to lower case, and
appending a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>.h</TT
> suffix. For example the kernel
package <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGPKG_KERNEL</TT
> will involve a header file
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pkgconf/kernel.h</TT
>. If a
configuration contained some other package
<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>XYZPKG_KERNEL</TT
> then this would attempt to use the
same configuration header file, with unfortunate effects. Case
sensitivity could introduce problems as well, so a package
<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>xyzpkg_kernel</TT
> would involve the same problem. Even
if the header file names preserved the case of the package name, not
all file systems are case sensitive. There is no simple solution to
this problem. Changing the names of the generated configuration header
files would involve a major incompatible change to the interface, to
solve a problem which is essentially hypothetical in nature.</P
