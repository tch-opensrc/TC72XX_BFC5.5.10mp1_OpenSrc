NAME="LANGUAGE.DATABASE">Updating the <SPAN

><P
>The current implementation of the component framework requires that
all packages be present in a single component repository and listed in
that repository's <SPAN
CLASS="DATABASE"
>ecos.db</SPAN
> database. This is not
generally a problem for application developers who can consider the
component repository a read-only resource, except when adding or
removing packages via the administration tool. However it means that
component writers need to do their development work inside a
component repository as well, and update the database with details of
their new package or packages. Future enhancements to the component
framework may allow new components to be developed outside a
repository. </P
><P
>Like most files related to the component framework, the
<SPAN
CLASS="DATABASE"
>ecos.db</SPAN
> database is actually a <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Tcl</SPAN
> script.
Typical package entries would look like this:</P

>Each package should have one or more aliases. The first alias is
typically used when listing the known packages, because a string like
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>C&nbsp;library</TT
> is a bit easier to read and
understand than <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGPKG_LIBC</TT
>. The other aliases are
not used for output, but are accepted on input. For example the
<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>ecosconfig</SPAN
> command-line
tool will accept <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>add&nbsp;libc</TT

as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

><TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>directory</TT
></DT
><DD
><P
>This is used to specify the location of the package relative to the
root of the component repository. It should be noted that in the
current component framework this location cannot be changed in
subsequent releases of the package: if for some reason it is desirable
to install a new release elsewhere in the repository, all the old
versions must first be uninstalled; the database cannot hold two
separate locations for one package.</P

>The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>script</TT

package's top-level <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>CDL</SPAN
> script, in other words the one containing the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>cdl_package</TT
> definition. If the package follows the <A
HREF="package.html#PACKAGE.HIERARCHY"
>directory layout conventions</A
> then
this script will be in the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>cdl</TT
>
sub-directory, otherwise it will be relative to the package's top-level
directory. Again once a release has been made this file should not
change in later releases. In practice the top-level script is generally
named after the package itself, so changing its name is unlikely to be
useful. </P

>Most of the information in the <SPAN
CLASS="DATABASE"

be obtained by a relatively simple utility. This would be passed a
single argument identifying a package's top-level <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>CDL</SPAN
> script. The
directory path relative to the component repository root could be
determined from the filename. The name, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>description</TT
>
and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>hardware</TT
> fields could be obtained from the
script's <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>cdl_package</TT
> command. The <SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>display</SPAN
> property would supply
the first alias, additional aliases could be obtained by extending the
syntax of that property or by other means. Something along these lines
may be provided by a future release of the component framework.</P
