>The support in the current implementation of the component framework
for building and running test cases is limited, and should be enhanced
considerably in a future version. Compatibility with the existing
mechanisms described below will be maintained if possible, but this
cannot be guaranteed.</P
></TD

></TABLE
></DIV
><P
>Whenever possible packages should be shipped with one or more test
cases. This allows users to check that all packages function correctly
in their particular configuration and on their target, which may be
custom hardware unavailable to the package developer. The component
framework needs to provide a way of building such test cases. For
example, if a makefile system is used then there could be a
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>make&nbsp;tests</TT
> target to build the test cases, or
possibly a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>make&nbsp;check</TT
> target to build and run
the test cases and process all the results. Unfortunately there are
various complications.</P
><P
>Not every test case will be applicable to every configuration. For
example if the user has disabled the C library's
<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGPKG_LIBC_STDIO</TT
> component then there is no point
in building or running any of the test cases for that component. This
implies that test cases need to be associated with configuration
options somehow. It is possible for the test case to use one or more
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>#ifdef</TT
> statements to check whether or not it is
applicable in the current configuration, and compile to a null program
when not applicable. This is inefficient because the test case will
still get built and possibly run, even though it will not provide any
useful information.</P
><P
>Many packages involve direct interaction with hardware, for example a
serial line or an ethernet interface. In such cases it is only
worthwhile building and running the test if there is suitable software
running at the other end of the serial line or listening on the same
ethernet segment, and that software would typically have to run on the
host. Of course the serial line in question may be hooked up to a
different piece of hardware which the application needs to talk to, so
disconnecting it and then hooking it up to the host for running some
tests may be undesirable. The decision as to whether or not to build
the test depends not just on the eCos configuration but also on the
hardware setup and the availability of suitable host software.</P
><P
>There are different kinds of tests, and it is not always desirable to
run all of them. For example a package may contain a number of stress
tests intended to run for long periods of time, possibly days or
longer. Such tests should certainly be distinguished somehow from
ordinary test cases so that users will not run them accidentally and
wonder how long they should wait for a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>pass</TT
> message
before giving up. Stress tests may also have dependencies on the
hardware configuration and on host software, for example a network
stress test may require lots of ethernet packets.</P
><P
>In the current implementation of the component framework these issues
are not yet addressed. Instead there is only very limited support for
building test cases. Any package can define a calculated configuration
option of the form
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYGPKG_&lt;package-name&gt;_TESTS</TT
>, whose value is a
list of test cases. The <SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>calculated</SPAN
> property can involve an
expression so it is possible to adapt to a small number of
configuration options, but this quickly becomes unwieldy. A typical
example would be:</P
><TABLE

                tests/testcx6 tests/testcx7 tests/testcx8 \
                tests/testcx9 tests/testintr" }
            description   "
This option specifies the set of tests for the uITRON compatibility layer."
        }</PRE

>This implies that there is a file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>tests/test1.c</TT
>
or <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>tests/test1.cxx</TT
> in the package's directory.
The commands that will be used to build the test case will take the
form:</P
><TABLE
BORDER="5"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0F0"
WIDTH="70%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>    $(CC) -c $(INCLUDE_PATH) $(CFLAGS) -o &lt;build path&gt;/test1.o \
         &lt;source path&gt;/tests/test1.c
    $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) -o &lt;install path&gt;/tests/test1 &lt;build_path&gt;/test1.o</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
><P
>The variables <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$(CC)</TT
> and so on are determined in the
same way as for custom build steps. The various paths and the current
directory will depend on the exact build system being used, and are
subject to change. As usual the sources in the component repository
are treated as a read-only resources, intermediate files live in the
build tree, and the desired executables should end up in the install
tree. </P
><P
>Each test source file must be self-contained. It is not possible at
present to build a little per-package library that can be used by the
test cases, or to link together several object files to produce a
single test executable. In some cases it may be possible to
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>#include</TT
> source code from a shared file in order to
avoid unnecessary code replication. There is no support for
manipulating compiler or linker flags for individual test cases: the
flags that will be used for all files are <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$(CFLAGS)</TT
>
and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$(LDFLAGS)</TT
>, as per custom build steps. Note
that it is possible for a package to define options of the form
<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGPKG_&lt;PACKAGE-NAME&gt;_LDFLAGS_ADD</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGPKG_&lt;PACKAGE-NAME&gt;_LDFLAGS_REMOVE</TT
>. These
will affect test cases, but in the absence of custom build steps they
will have no other effect on the build.</P
