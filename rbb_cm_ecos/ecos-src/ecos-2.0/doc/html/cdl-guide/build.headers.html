NAME="BUILD.HEADERS">Configuration Header File Generation</H1
><P
>Configuration options can affect a build in two main ways. First,
enabling a configuration option or other <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>CDL</SPAN
> entity can result in
various files being built and added to a library, thus providing
functionality to the application code. However this mechanism can only
operate at a rather coarse grain, at the level of entire source files.
Hence the component framework also generates configuration header
files containing mainly C preprocessor <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>#define</TT
>
directives. Package source code can then <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>#include</TT
>
the appropriate header files and use <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>#if</TT
>,
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>#ifdef</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>#ifndef</TT
> directives to
adapt accordingly. In this way configuration options can be used to
enable or disable entire functions within a source file or just a
single line, whichever is appropriate.</P
><P
>The configuration header files end up in the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>include/pkgconf</TT
> subdirectory of the
install tree. There will be one header file for the system as a whole,
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pkgconf/system.h</TT
>, and there will
be additional header files for each package, for example
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pkgconf/kernel.h</TT
>. The header files
are generated when creating or updating the build and install trees,
which needs to happen after every change to the configuration.</P
><P
>The component framework processes each package in the configuration
one at a time. The exact order in which the packages are processed is
not defined, so the order in which <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>#define's</TT
> will
end up in the global <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pkgconf/system.h</TT
> header may vary. However
for any given configuration the order should remain consistent until
packages are added to or removed from the system. This avoids
unnecessary changes to the global header file and hence unnecessary
rebuilds of the packages and of application code because of header
file dependency handling.</P
><P
>Within a given package the various components, options and interfaces
will be processed in the order in which they were defined in the
corresponding <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>CDL</SPAN
> scripts. Typically the data in the configuration
headers consists only of a sequence of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>#define's</TT
> so
the order in which these are generated is irrelevant, but some
properties such as <SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>define_proc</SPAN
> can be used to add arbitrary data to
a configuration header and hence there may be dependencies on the
order. It should be noted that re-parenting an option below some other
package has no effect on which header file will contain the
corresponding <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>#define</TT
>: the preprocessor directives
will always end up in the header file for the package that defines the
option, or in the global configuration header.</P
><P
>There are six properties which affect the process of generating header
files:
<A
HREF="ref.define-header.html"
><SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>define_header</SPAN
></A
>,
<A
HREF="ref.no-define.html"

><SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"

<A

<A

></A
>, and
<A
HREF="ref.define-proc.html"
><SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>define_proc</SPAN
></A
>.</P
><P
>The <SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>define_header</SPAN
> property can only occur in the body of a
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>cdl_package</TT
> command and specifies the name of the header file which
should contain the package's configuration data, for example:</P

><P
>Given such a <SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>define_header</SPAN

use the file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pkgconf/xyzzy.h</TT
> for
the package's configuration data. If a package does not have
a <SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>define_header</SPAN

from the package's name. This involves:</P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>All characters in the package name up to and including the first
underscore are removed. For example <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"

is converted to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>KERNEL</TT
>, and
<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGPKG_HAL_ARM</TT

<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>HAL_ARM</TT
>.</P
></LI
><LI
><P

lower case, yielding e.g. <TT

<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>hal_arm</TT

></LI
><LI
><P
>A <TT

<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>kernel.h</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>hal_arm.h</TT
>.</P
></LI
></OL
><P
>Because of the naming restrictions on configuration options, this
should result in a valid filename. There is a small possibility of a
file name class, for example <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGPKG_PLUGH</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGPKG_plugh</TT
> would both end up trying to use the
same header file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pkgconf/plugh.h</TT

but the use of lower case letters for package names violates the
naming conventions. It is not legal to use the <SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"
>define_header</SPAN
>
property to put the configuration data for several packages in a
single header file. The resulting behaviour is undefined.</P
><P
>Once the name of the package's header file has been determined and the
file has been opened, the various components, options and interfaces
in the package will be processed starting with the package itself. The
following steps are involved:</P

both active and enabled.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The next step is to generate a default <TT

the current option. If this option has a <SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"

default <TT

continues for <SPAN

configuration data suffices for existing packages written in some
combination of C, C++ and assembler. It can also be used in
conjunction with some other languages, for example by first passing
the source code through the C preprocessor and feeding the result into
the appropriate compiler. In future versions of the component
framework additional programming languages such as Java may be
supported, and the configuration data may also be written to files in
some format other than C preprocessor directives. </P

>At present there is no way for application or package source code to
get hold of all the configuration details related to the current
hardware. Instead that information is spread over various different

some of the information going into <TT

some future release of the system there will be another global
configuration header file <TT

which <TT

configuration headers. The desirability and feasibility of such a
scheme are still to be determined. To avoid future incompatibility
problems as a result of any such changes, it is recommended that all
hardware packages (in other packages containing the <SPAN

property) use the <SPAN

of the application.</P

configuration options, for example to do different things for ROM and
RAM booting systems, or when it is necessary to support several
different target boards. This is especially true if the code in question
is really re-usable library code which has not been converted to an
eCos package, and hence cannot use any CDL facilities.</P

>In addition to determining whether or not a package is present, the
global configuration header file can also be used to find out the
specific version of a package that is being used. This can be useful
if a more recent version exports additional functionality. It may also
be necessary to adapt to incompatible changes in the exported
interface or to changes in behaviour. For each package the

><P
>There are a number of problems associated with such version
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>#define's</TT
>. The first restriction is that the
package must follow the standard naming conventions, so the package
name must be of the form <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>xxxPKG_yyy</TT
>. The three
characters immediately preceding the first underscore must be
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>PKG</TT

<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NUM</TT

<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>#define's</TT

convention then no version <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>#define's</TT

generated. </P
><P
>Assuming the package does follow the naming conventions, the
configuration tools will always generate three version
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>#define's</TT
> for the major, minor, and release
numbers. The symbol names are obtained from the package name by
replacing <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>PKG</TT
> with <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NUM</TT
> and
appending <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>_VERSION_MAJOR</TT
>,
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>_VERSION_MINOR</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>_VERSION_RELEASE</TT
>. It is assumed that the resulting
symbols will not clash with any configuration option names. The values
for the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>#define's</TT
> are determined by searching the
version string for sequences of digits, optionally preceded by a minus
sign. It is possible that some or all of the numbers are absent in any
given version string, in which case <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>-1</TT
> will be used
in the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>#define</TT
>. For example, given a version string
of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>V1.12beta</TT

<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1</TT

CLASS="LITERAL"

the release number is <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>beta</TT

<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>-1</TT

><P
>There is special case code for the version <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>current</TT

which typically corresponds to a development version obtained via
anonymous CVS or similar means. The configuration system has special
built-in knowledge of this version, and will assume it is more recent
than any specific release number. The global configuration header
defines a special symbol <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYGNUM_VERSION_CURRENT</TT

and this will be used as the major version number when version
<TT
