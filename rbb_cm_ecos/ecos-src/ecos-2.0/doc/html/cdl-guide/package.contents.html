><P
>Any given packages need not contain all of these. It is compulsory to
have at least one <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

component framework would be unable to process it. Some packages may
not have any source code: it is possible to have a package that merely
defines a common interface which can then be implemented by several
other packages, especially in the context of device drivers; however
it is still common to have some code in such packages to avoid
replicating shareable code in all of the implementation packages.
Similarly it is possible to have a package with no exported header
files, just source code that implements an existing interface: for
example an ethernet device driver might just implement a standard
interface and not provide any additional functionality. Packages do
not need to come with any on-line documentation, although this may
affect how many people will want to use the package. Much the same
applies to per-package test cases.</P

>For example, if a package has an <TT

framework will assume that all header files in and below that
directory are exported header files and will do the right thing at
build time. Similarly if there is <SPAN
CLASS="PROPERTY"

location of on-line documentation then the component framework will
first look in the <TT

sub-directory.</P
><P
>This directory layout is just a guideline, it is not enforced by the
component framework. For simple packages it often makes more sense to
have all of the files in just one directory. For example a package
could just contain the files <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>hello.cxx</TT
>,
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>hello.h</TT

CLASS="FILENAME"
>hello.html</TT

<TT

<TT

file, although this can be overridden with the <A

><SPAN

there is a <SPAN

>hello.html</TT

and there is no <TT

package's top-level and everything will just work. Much the same

install trees. The configuration header files will be generated at
this time. Depending on the host environment, the component framework
will also generate makefiles or some other way of building the various

There are two ways in which one package can affect another: by means
of the exported header files, which define a public interface; or via
the <SPAN

><P
>This encapsulation is a deliberate aspect of the overall <SPAN

component framework design. In most cases it does not cause any
problems for component writers. In some cases enforcing a clean
separation between interface and implementation details can improve
the code. Also it reduces problems when a package gets upgraded:
component writers are free to do pretty much anything on the
implementation side, including renaming every single source file; care
has to be taken only with the exported header files and with the <SPAN

data, because those have the potential of impacting other packages.
Application code is similarly unable to access package implementation
details, only the exported interface.</P
><P
>Very occasionally the inability of one package to see implementation
details of another does cause problems. One example occurs in HAL
packages, where it may be desirable for the architectural, variant and
platform HAL's to share some information that should not be visible to
other packages or to application code. This may be addressed in the
future by introducing the concept of <TT

packages, just as a C++ class can have <TT

the programming language used to code the components, provided
reasonable precautions are taken to avoid syntax clashes between
preprocessor statements and actual code. This would make it easier in
future to support languages other than C and C++. Second, configurable
code can make use of advanced preprocessing facilities such as loops
and recursion. The disadvantage is that component writers would have
to learn about a new preprocessor and embed appropriate directives in
the code. This makes it much more difficult to turn existing code into
components, and it involves extra training costs for the component
writers.</P

respects this is a clean approach to configurability, but it has
limitations. It cannot be used in the declarations of data structures

by configuration options, which may make it more difficult to

facilities are rather limited, for example there is no looping

This may affect sources in the kernel package, in other packages, and
in application source code. Second, if the application makes use of
this function somewhere but the application developer has
misconfigured the system and disabled this functionality anyway then
there will now be a compile-time error when building the application.

provided by the package. The first result is that there is no longer a
dependency on the kernel configuration header. The second result is
that an application file using the timed-lock function will now
compile, but the application will fail to link. At this stage the
application developer still has to intervene, change the
configuration, and rebuild the system. However no application
recompilations are necessary, just a relink.</P

>On-line package documentation should be in HTML format. The component
framework imposes no special limitations: component writers can decide
which version of the HTML specification should be followed; they can
also decide on how best to cope with the limitations of different
browsers. In general it is a good idea to keep things simple.</P

>Packages should normally come with one or more test cases. This allows
application developers to verify that a given package works correctly
on their particular hardware and in their particular configuration,
making it slightly more likely that they will attempt to find bugs in
their own code rather than automatically blaming the component
writers.</P
><P
>At the time of writing the application developer support for building
and running test cases via the component framework is under review and
likely to change. Currently each test case should consist of a single
C or C++ source file that can be compiled with the package's set of
compiler flags and linked like any application program. Each test case
should use the testing API defined by the infrastructure. A
magically-named calculated configuration option of the form
<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CYGPKG_&lt;PACKAGE-NAME&gt;_TESTS</TT
> lists the test
cases.</P

>On occasion it would be useful for an <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>eCos</SPAN
> package to be shipped
with host-side support. This could take the form of an additional tool
needed to build that package. It could be an application intended to
communicate with the target-side package code and display monitoring
information. It could be a utility needed for running the package test
cases, especially in the case of device drivers. The component
framework does not yet provide any such support for host-side
software, and there are obvious issues related to portability to the
different machines that can be used for hosts. This issue may get
addressed in some future release. In some cases custom build steps can
be subverted to do things on the host side rather than the target
side, but this is not recommended.</P
