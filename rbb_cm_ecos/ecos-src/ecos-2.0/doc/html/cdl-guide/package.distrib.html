>eCos package distribution files are gzipped GNU tar archives which
contain both the source code for one or more <SPAN

data file containing package information to be added to the component

following rules:</P

describes this data format. Note that a database consistency check is
performed by the <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>eCos</SPAN
> Administration Tool when
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pkgadd.db</TT
> has been appended to the database. Any
new target entries which refer to unknown packages will be removed at
this stage.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The package source code must be placed in one or more <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>&lt;package-path&gt;/&lt;version&gt;</TT
>
directories in the tar archive, where each &lt;package-path&gt;
directory path is specified as the directory attribute of one of the
packages entries in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pkgadd.db</TT
>.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>An optional license agreement file named
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pkgadd.txt</TT
> may be placed in the root of the tar
archive. It should contain text with a maximum line length of 79
characters. If this file exists, the contents will be presented to the
user during installation of the package. The <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>eCos</SPAN
> Package
Administration Tool will then prompt the user with the question
<TT
CLASS="PROMPT"
>"Do you accept all the terms of the preceding license
agreement?"</TT
>. The user must respond
<TT

the installation.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Optional template files may be placed in one or more <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>templates/&lt;template_name&gt;</TT

directories in the tar archive. Note that such template files would be
appropriate only where the packages to be distributed have a complex
dependency relationship with other packages. Typically, a third party
package can be simply added to an eCos configuration based on an
existing core template and the provision of new templates would not be
appropriate. <A

information on templates.</P

>The distribution file must be given a <TT

> (not
<TT

<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.epk</TT
> file extension serves to distinguish <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>eCos</SPAN

package distributions files from generic gzipped GNU tar archives. It
also discourages users from attempting to extract the package from the
archive manually. The file browsing dialog of the <SPAN

Administration Tool lists only those files which have a
<TT

Administration Tool ensures that the installed files are given the
appropriate host-specific line endings.</P

object code is not recommended. All binary files must be given a

may already have. For example, the GIF image file

><P
>Create a temporary directory <TT

distribution file contents and copy the source files of the new
packages into this directory, preserving the relative path to the
package. In the case of a new package at <TT

>mypkg/current</TT

></TD
></TR

><P
>Where more than one package is to be distributed in a single package
distribution file, copy each package in the above manner. Note that
multiple packages distributed in a single package distribution file
cannot be installed separately. Where such flexibility is required,
distribution of each new package in separate package distribution files
is recommended.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Copy any template files associated with the distributed packages into
the temporary directory, preserving the relative path to the template.
For example:</P

>Remove any files from the temporary directory hierarchy which you do
not want to distribute with the packages (eg object files, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>CVS</TT
> directories).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Add a <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.bin</TT

files. For example, if the packages contains GIF image files (*.gif)
for documentation purposes, such files must be renamed to *.gif.bin as
follows:</P

Package Administration Tool.</P
></LI

><P
>Extract the package records for the new packages from the package
database file at <SPAN
CLASS="DATABASE"
>$ECOS_REPOSITORY/ecos.db</SPAN
> and
create a new file containing these records at
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>$PKGTMP/pkgadd.db</TT

directory hierarchy). Any target records which reference the
distributed packages must also be provided in pkgadd.db.</P

>Rename the version directories under <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>$PKGTMP</TT

the versions of the packages you are distributing. For example,
version 1.0 of a package may use the version directory name <TT
