	* support/file2c.tcl:
	Do not use an alignment attribute, since it is not honoured on
	all targets.
	
	* src/romfs.c:
	Remove alignment restrictions, since they are not actually needed
	yet and alignment is hard to guarantee on all targets.

2002-01-21  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* support/mk_romfs.c: Open image file in binary mode (for cygwin).
	Spotted by Warren Jasper.

	ROMFS.
