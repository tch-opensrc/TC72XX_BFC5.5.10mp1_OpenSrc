	detection and delivery to other packages.

2002-11-05  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	current key to NULL before invoking the destructor.

2002-02-14  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	file readable by mere humans. Some omissions and outdated
	information fixed, but not substantially changed from the
	original.

	* cdl/posix.cdl: Changed some definitions and dependencies so that

	Case #106952.

2001-12-11  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	CYGPKG_POSIX_SIGNALS component.

2001-08-06  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/posix.cdl: Reorganize dependencies so that signals, timers

	* src/mutex.cxx: New file, broken out of pthreads.cxx, as most
	of it is not fixed to the pthreads implementation, and I've fixed
	the bits that were too tied to it.

	* src/pprivate.h: Conditionalize definitions that are specific
	to CYGPKG_POSIX_PTHREAD. Ditto for prototypes for CYGPKG_POSIX_SIGNALS
	and CYGPKG_POSIX_TIMERS. Move PTHREAD_ENTRY/RETURN etc. macros

	entry/return macros, as per above.

	* src/signal.cxx (cyg_sigqueue): Don't just set non-queueable signals 
	pending - also forcibly wake up any blocked threads.
	(siglongjmp): Use new layout of sigjmp_buf.

2001-08-03  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	Imported from a development branch:
	
	2001-06-27  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

		* tests/pthread3.c:
		Modified the loop that waits for the threads to get going so that
		it will function correctly in an SMP system, where the threads
		will run in parallel.

		* tests/mutex3.c: Disabled this test for SMP systems. It depends
		too much on predicting the priority-driven execution order of the
		threads. In an SMP system, some threads will run in parallel and
		falsify the assumptions.

	2001-05-25  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

		* src/signal.cxx (siglongjmp): Minor change to satisfy latest C++
		compiler.

2001-04-20  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/time.cxx (cyg_ticks_to_timespec): Actually don't bother

	(pthread_cond_wait): Ditto.
	(pthread_cond_timedwait): Ditto.

2000-11-07  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/signal.cxx (cyg_posix_thread_siginit): Add extra thread

	* tests/signal2.c (cause_illegal_access): Don't loop forever.

2000-10-16  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/sigsetjmp.h (sigsetjmp): Various fixes to make portable
	across all HALs (by avoiding CYGARC_JMP_BUF_SIZE) and remove warnings.
	* src/signal.cxx (siglongjmp): Likewise

2000-10-12  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	they are not needed.
	Changed CYG_TEST_NA() calls to CYG_TEST_INFO() and changed
	CYG_TEST_FINISH() to CYG_TEST_PASS_FINISH(). With the _NA's there,
	the first unsupported exception just terminates the program, and
	does not give any subsequent supported ones a chance to run.

2000-10-12  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/timer1.c (main): Fix exit check.

2000-10-11  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	a reserved name space but this makes explicit it is implementation-
	and not standard-defined
	(PTHREAD_ENTRY_VOID): Define for funcs that take no args
	(pthread_testcancel): Call PTHREAD_ENTRY_VOID()

	* include/pthread.h: Rename pthread_canceled -> cyg_pthread_canceled

2000-07-20  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/pthread.cxx: Use isoinfra to determine presence of malloc()

	calling main() directly.
	Track number of threads waiting to be joined, so we can tell in

	to call exit()

	* src/main.cxx: obsolete, removed

2000-07-13  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/signal.cxx: Added ISO C compatibility functions signal() and
	raise().

	* src/pthread.cxx: Added for(;;) loop to end of pthread_exit().
	pthread_exit() is marked with the noreturn attribute, and without
	this some compilers generate a call to abort() here in case
	Cyg_Thread::exit() returns. The loop avoids this.

2000-06-06  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/mqueue.cxx (mq_receive): Fix non-portable treatment of mode flags
	(mq_send):  Ditto
	* tests/mqueue2.c (main): Ditto

2000-05-24  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/pthread2.c: Added this program to test per-thread data
	handling.

	* tests/pthread3.c: Added this program to test execution of
	cancellation handler.

	* src/pthread.cxx: Fixed some bugs revealed by new test programs.

	* cdl/posix.cdl: Added two new pthread tests.

2000-05-22  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* cdl/posix.cdl (CYGPKG_POSIX): Require
	CYGIMP_KERNEL_SCHED_SORTED_QUEUES

2000-05-20  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* tests/mqueue1.c (cyg_user_start): Define correctly
	* tests/mqueue2.c (cyg_user_start): Likewise

	* src/pprivate.h (cyg_sigqueue): Make struct sigevent * arg const since
	it is, and it prevents warnings elsewhere
	* src/signal.cxx (cyg_sigqueue): ditto

	* tests/signal2.c: Use CYG_TEST_NA, not CYG_TEST_INFO (otherwise
	the test farm may fail the tests because there are no PASSes or NAs)

	* cdl/posix.cdl (CYGPKG_POSIX): We need errno and error codes, so
	require them
	Move some of the package implements into the components
	Add message queue configuration, build mqueue.cxx and the mqueue1 and
	mqueue2 tests
	Move some calculated options into isoinfra, implemented as interfaces
	so that unistd.h and limits.h can get the values

	* include/limits.h: Move _POSIX_* macros into isoinfra limits.h
	since they are implementation independent

	* src/mqueue.cxx: Add POSIX message queue implementation
	* tests/mqueue1.c, tests/mqueue2.c: and tests

2000-05-18  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/pprivate.h:
	* src/pthread.cxx:
	* src/signal.cxx:
	* src/time.cxx:
	Added prioritization of static kernel objects.

2000-05-17  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/pthread.cxx:
	To reduce the static memory required by this code, the
	pthread_info structure for a pthread is now allocated in the stack
	memory for that thread, and not in a static table. The table is
	now just an array of pointers. The per-thread data array is now
	also allocated onto the stack only when first required.

	* include/pthread.h: Removed some redundant code.

	* include/limits.h: Added PTHREAD_STACK_OVERHEAD to record
	management overhead imposed on POSIX threads stacks. This is added
	to the HAL minimum requirement to generate PTHREAD_STACK_MIN.

	* src/pprivate.h (pthread_info):
	* include/types.h (pthread_attr_t): Converted a number of integer
	state and boolean fields to bitfields.

	* cdl/pthread.cdl:
	Added requirement for CYGFUN_KERNEL_THREADS_STACK_LIMIT.

2000-05-16  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/types.h: Added stacksize_valid to pthread_attr_t
	structure.

	* include/signal.h:
	Added SI_EXCEPT to mark any signals that were caused by an
	exception. Removed conditions around SIGBUS.

	* src/startup.cxx (cyg_posix_start):
	Added call to cyg_posix_exception_start(). 

	* src/signal.cxx:
	Rearranged cyg_deliver_signals() so that it is possible to
	longjmp() out of a signal handler without leaving signal handling
	code in an inconsistent state.
	Added handling of SIG_IGN in sigaction().

	* src/pthread.cxx: Added setting and checking of stacksize_valid.

	* src/pprivate.h: Added cyg_deliver_signals() as an export of
	signal system. Added exports from except.cxx.

	* src/except.cxx: Added this file to handle delivery of exceptions
	into the POSIX signal mechanism.

	* cdl/posix.cdl: Added except.cxx to compile list, added signal2
	to tests. Added requirement on kernel exception processing.

	* tests/tm_basic.cxx: Tidied up a compilation warning.

	* tests/signal2.c: Added this test for exception signal generation.

	* tests/mutex3.c: Fixed stupid bug.
	
2000-05-10  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/pprivate.h: Added cyg_posix_clock_start() prototype.

	* src/startup.cxx: Added call to cyg_posix_clock_start().

	* src/time.cxx: Added startup routine to initialize
	converters. Fixed error result bug in timer_delete().

	* include/signal.h: Removed some configuration tests which are now
	done in CDL.

	* cdl/posix.cdl: Added configury for the signals component. Added
	tm_basic to tests.

	* tests/tm_basic.cxx:
	Added this POSIXized version of the tm_basic test. Note that this
	has not been entirely converted. While the code being tested is
	POSIX, the timing infrastructure remains a mish-mash of kernel,
	KAPI and HAL code.

2000-05-04  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/time.cxx:
	Many changes to implement the delivery of signals on timer expiry.
	Also added timer_delete().

	* src/signal.cxx:
	cyg_sigqueue() and cyg_deliver_signals() may now only be called
	from within the context of a POSIX thread, either from an API call
	or an ASR.
	cyg_deliver_signals() can now cope with a signal that has
	SA_SIGINFO set but no signals queued. It also determines
	dynamically whether to lock the signal_mutex.
	cyg_deliver_signals() is no longer called implicitly from
	cyg_sigqueue() - so a number of expicit calls have been added.
	
	* src/sched.cxx:
	Added this file to implement scheduling API.

	* src/pthread.cxx:
	Moved priority translation macros to pprivate.h.
	Removed errno handling, now done in isoinfra package.
	Added iterative calls to per-thread data destructors.

	* src/pprivate.h:
	Removed error field from pthread_info structure.
	Moved priority translation macros here.
	Removed prototype for cyg_deliver_signals().
	Added prototype for cyg_posix_timer_asr().

	* include/time.h: Added timer_delete() which was mysteriously
	omitted.

	* cdl/posix.cdl: Added sched.cxx to compile list and timer1.c to
	tests.

	* tests/signal1.c: 
	* tests/pthread1.c:
	Fixed bug in use of stack sizes.

	* tests/timer1.c: 
	Added test for use of timers.
		
2000-05-02  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/sched.h: No longer needed - just use the default definition
	in isoinfra

	* include/errno.h: No longer needed - errno provision now comes from
	CYGPKG_ERROR
	
	* include/sys/types.h: Moved to include/types.h
	
	* cdl/posix.cdl, cdl/pthread.cdl: Put include files in cyg/posix, and
	configure CYGPKG_ISOINFRA to include the appropriate headers
	
	* include/semaphore.h: Don't need to check kernel - including
	pkgconf/kernel.h would already fail
	Give SEM_FAILED a type so casting behaves in C++
	
	* include/signal.h: This uses pid_t etc., so include <sys/types.h>
	Add signal() and raise() prototypes (to allow libc compilation, even
	though they aren't implemented yet)
	
	* include/time.h: Remove unnecessary includes. Move clockid_t and
	timer_t definitions here from sys/types.h since this is where the
	standard says they must live. 
	
	* src/pprivate.h: Include signal.h and limits.h since their contents
	are used later in the file.	

2000-04-28  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/signal.cxx:
	Added implementations of alarm(), pause() and sleep().
	Modified cyg_sigqueue() so that it could be called from an ASR.
	Added cyg_posix_signal_asr() to do signal processing in ASRs.
	Miscellaneous bug fixes.

	* src/pthread.cxx:
	Added pthread_count to count number of threads created.
	Added call to signal ASR function in main ASR.
	Added cyg_posix_pthread_release_thread() to seek out and kick a
	thread to which a given set of signals may be delivered.

	* src/pprivate.h:
	Added some more functions that are shared between POSIX
	subsystems.

	* include/signal.h:
	Added alarm(), pause() and sleep() prototypes. 

	* tests/signal1.c: Added this test for various aspects of signal
	handling.

	* cdl/posix.cdl: Added signal1 test.

2000-04-20  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/signal.cxx: Added this file to contain signal handling code.

	* src/time.cxx: Made tick<->timespec converters exported to
	rest of POSIX subsystem. Enabled interface to signal mechanism for
	notifying timer expiration.

	* src/pthread.cxx:
	Made pthread_mutex exported to rest of POSIX subsystem.
	Exported pthread_info_id().
	Added thread init and destroy functions for signal subsystem.

	* src/startup.cxx: Added call to cyg_posix_signal_start().

	* src/pprivate.h: Added signal handling fields support to
	pthread_info structure. Added extra internal interfaces to support
	signal handling code.

	* include/signal.h: Added _how_ argument values for the sigmask
	functions.

	* cdl/posix.cdl: Added signal.cxx to compile list.

2000-04-13  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/time.h: 
	* src/time.cxx:
	Added implementation of clock and timer functions. These are
	currently untested since they need working signals.

2000-04-12  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/pprivate.h: Added cancellation support fields to
	pthread_info structure. Made pthread_self_info() exported.

	* include/semaphore.h: Added SEM_FAILED plus misc. tidies.

	* include/pthread.h: Added PTHREAD_CANCELED.

	* include/errno.h: Fixed cyg_pthread_errno_p() return type.

	* src/pthread.cxx:
	Added pthread_reap() to clean up exited threads.
	Added support for cancellation.
	Added cyg_posix_errno_p().

	* src/time.cxx:
	Added this file to implement time functionality. At present only
	nanosleep() is actually implemented.

	* src/sem.cxx:
	Added this file to implement semaphore functionality.

	* cdl/pthread.cdl:
	Added some extra configuration requirements.

	* cdl/posix.cdl:
	Added some more files to compile.
	Added semaphore configuration.

	* tests/mutex3.c:
	Added this test program. This is actually a POSIXized version of
	Hugo's splendid kernel test of the same name. It exercises quite a
	lot of the pthread infrastructure and is thus a good test to run.

	* tests/pthread1.c:
	Added proper comment headers and added full testing stuff.
	
2000-04-10  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/pprivate.h: 
	* src/pthread.cxx:
	Added per-thread data support.

2000-04-06  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/pthread.cxx:
	Filled in implementations of lots of functions.

	* src/main.cxx:
	Added this file to contain a default main. This is currenly just a
	duplicate of the same file from the C library. Work is needed to
	combine these.

	* include/sys/types.h:
	Modified pthread_mutex_t to conform to kernel structure.

	* cdl/pthread.cdl:
	Added support for main thread.

	* cdl/posix.cdl:
	Added main.cxx to compile list.

2000-03-31  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/pthread.cdl: 
	* cdl/posix.cdl:
	Added CDL files to configure POSIX subsystem.

	* src/pprivate.h: 
	* src/pthread.cxx: 
	* src/startup.cxx: 
	Added these files to begin implementation of POSIX package.
	
	* include/pthread.h: 
	* include/sched.h: 
	* include/signal.h: 
	* include/time.h: 
	* include/sys/types.h: 
	Many changes needed by implementation work.
	
	* include/limits.h: 
	* include/errno.h: 
	Added these header files.
	
2000-03-24  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/sys/types.h: 
	* include/time.h: 
	* include/sched.h: 
	* include/pthread.h: 
	* include/signal.h:
	* include/semaphore.h: 
	* include/mqueue.h: 
	Roughed out (most of) the set of POSIX headers for the
	functionality we are currently going to support. These files are
	currently neither fully standard conformant nor implementation
	ready. Much work is still needed to make them so. Watch this
	space.
