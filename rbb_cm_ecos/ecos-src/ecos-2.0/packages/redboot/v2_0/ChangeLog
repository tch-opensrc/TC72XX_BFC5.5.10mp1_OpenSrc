	* src/io.c (verify_action_with_timeout): 
	* include/redboot.h: New function verify_action_with_timeout().

	assumed padding bytes since they may well be actual data. Don't
	read anything after the EOF package is received.

	padding culling code. So in the end, only the EOF-package read
	was at fault.

	* src/main.c: Tweak cksum output.

	* src/flash.c (fis_create): language tweaks.

	* src/main.c: Always call expand_aliases - leave it to that
	function to look for flash aliases when appropriate.

	aliases, but also call flash_lookup_alias when defined.

	getc_t and terminate_t types.

	* src/load.c: Use getc_t/terminate_t types. Made raw load abort if
	user tries to load a file too big for memory.

	* cdl/redboot.cdl: Compile alias.c.

2002-05-14  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	(fis_lookup): Image name lookup is case insensitive.

2002-05-10  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c: Lots of restructuring in support of combined
	FIS and FCONFIG data.

	* cdl/redboot.cdl:

2002-04-21  Paul Fine  <pfine@delcomsys.com>

	* src/flash.c (flash_get_config, load_flash_config): Save a
	pointer to the configuration structure in FLASH.  If
	flash_get_config fails to find a config item, check to make sure
	that the config structure in RAM has not been trashed.  If it has
	been trashed, set the pointer to the "readonly" version in FLASH
	and try to read the config item again.
	
	* cdl/redboot.cdl (CYGSEM_REDBOOT_FLASH_CONFIG_READONLY_FALLBACK):
	Added this flash config option to control the readonly fallback in
	flash.c

2002-03-05  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* doc/redboot.sgml: Add something about updating RedBoot on
	platforms using ROMRAM-startup type RedBoot. Also mention that fis
	create can get some of its information from the fis directory.
	Updated assabet details.

2002-03-01  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* redboot.sgml: Add diag docs and switch setting info for 80321.

2002-02-28  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c (do_flash_config): Add "-d" to the help info.

	* doc/redboot.sgml: Docuement the "-d" option for dumb terminals
	with fconfig - so you're not forced to use line editing.

2002-02-28  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/syscall.c: Moved SYS_ value definitions to the header file.
	* include/redboot.h: Same.

2002-02-27  David Howells  <dhowells@redhat.com>

	* sgml/redboot.sgml: Removed extraneous </para>.

2002-02-26  David Howells  <dhowells@redhat.com>

	* doc/redboot.sgml: Updated the ASB2305 notes to be more complete
	with respect to having two flash chips.

2002-02-19  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/net/net_io.c (net_io_init): Remove ISR installation. This
	was wrong way to fix problem.

2002-02-15  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/net/net_io.c (net_io_init): Install default ISR for ethernet.

2002-02-14  Patrick Doyle  <wpd@delcomsys.com>

	* src/fs/disk.c (disk_stream_read): Modified to return the number
	of bytes read instead of -1 when such number is less than was
	requested.
	
2002-02-06  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/syscall.c (sys_write): Call __flush after last __putc.
	(__flush): New function to flush console output.

2002-02-05  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/net/net_io.c (net_init): Set use_bootp and net_debug defaults
	properly.

2002-01-31  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/fs/ide.c (ide_packet_read_sectors): Pass errors on read.
	(ide_init): Ignore ATAPI devices that are not CDROM (like ZIP).

2002-01-30  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/net/net_io.c (start_console): Pick up config items to choose
	a console for special debug messages.  If it's not set, select
	channel 0 regardless, like it used to.
	(info_console_force, info_console_number): New fconfig options to
	control this channel *plus* forcing application special debug out
	to a particular serial.   This is crucial for debugging debugging
	itself, or debugging a networked app over the network when you're
	liable to get such messages popping out from the app as well as
	from RedBoot.

	* cdl/redboot.cdl (CYGDBG_REDBOOT_NET_DEBUG_CONSOLE_NUMBER):
	Option deleted, because this is now controlled by fconfig items.

2002-01-25  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/syscall.c (sys_profile_reset): New routine - doesn't do
	much, just NULLs the callback.  Useful placeholder in case more is
	needed in future, eg. reset the clock also.
	(__do_syscall): Calls the reset on syscall 2003.

2002-01-21  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c (do_flash_config): Enable a "dumb terminal" mode for
	fconfig, which does not pre-fill the buffer for editing, but
	merely prompts for a new value (or RET for old, for non-string
	values).  This is because telnet/kermit-like network terminal apps
	are not by default configured to pass all characters through.

2002-01-18  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/syscall.c (sys_timer_ticks): Change this to a cyg_uint64 to
	give better range for times() sanity in case we run the hardware
	clock ticking at a faster rate, or want to last > 8 days.

2002-01-16  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/syscall.c (sys_profile_frequency): Change frequency that is
	passed around to signed, so that we can enquire using -ve values.
	Re-order the logic a little so as to permit enquiries which do not
	modify what's set up in the hardware.  Adjust the times() counter
	when its HZ rate changes so it tells the truth.

2002-01-15  David Woodhouse  <dwmw2@cambridge.redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c: Better default for 'fis cr' - if we're programming
	an existing flash image, take img_size from the last-loaded image
	but length from the one that's already on the flash.
	
2002-01-14  David Woodhouse  <dwmw2@cambridge.redhat.com>

	* src/main.c: Useful defaults for cksum command.
	* src/flash.c: Useful defaults for fis create command.
	* src/load.c: Slight cleanup of file type detection.
	
2002-01-14  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/net/cksum.c: Added volatile keyword to union members to
	prevent compiler optimization messing things up.

2002-01-10  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/syscall.c (sys_timer_isr): Add CYGARC_HAL_SAVE_GP(); and
	CYGARC_HAL_RESTORE_GP(); around the callback invocation to protect
	ourselves from whatever the app routine might do along those lines.

2002-01-10  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/syscall.c (sys_timer_ticks): Explicitly initialize this.
	(sys_timer_isr): Call periodic callback function, with PC and SP
	of interrupted context, if set.
	(sys_profile_call_back): New routine to support
	gprof profiling of GNUPro/newlib apps via BSP_SYSCALLS.  Sets the
	periodic callback function, returning the old value.
	(sys_profile_frequency): Ditto, sets the frequency of the call, if
	possible, or zero => a mere inquiry.
	(sys_timer_init, sys_times): Be prepared for a dynamic non-default
	clock rate.
	(__do_syscall): Handle new case arms.

	* cdl/redboot.cdl (CYGSEM_REDBOOT_BSP_SYSCALLS): Changed to a
	component; want to add stuff in here later.
	(CYGSEM_REDBOOT_BSP_SYSCALLS_GPROF): New option
	to control inclusion of histogram profiling callback syscalls.

2002-01-10  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/main.c (do_version): Added year 2002.

2002-01-07  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c (lookup_alias): Remove warning.

2002-01-03  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/xyzModem.c (xyzModem_stream_read): BUG 57497
	Try and detect (and remove) ^Z characters placed at end of stream.  
	This data confuses higher processing, like the zlib decompression 
	routines.

2001-12-16  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/fs/ide.c: Add ATAPI support.
	* include/fs/ide.h: Add ATAPI defines.
	* src/fs/disk.c (disk_stream_open): Fix support for IDE CDROMs.
	(disk_parse_filename): Ditto.

2001-12-12  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* cdl/redboot.cdl (CYGDBG_REDBOOT_NET_DEBUG_CONSOLE_NUMBER): New
	option to control the console number for network debug messages.
	For platforms where serial0 is supported (due to common variant
	HAL code) but not connected; serial1 is all you get, say.

	* src/net/net_io.c (start_console): Use it.

2001-12-10  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* src/net/cksum.c (__pseudo_sum): Fixed method of adding protocol
	field to checksum. Some compilers optimize some of this away to
	give a bogus result.

2001-12-06  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/load.c (do_load): Fix warning.
	* src/main.c: Added support for dumping memory in 16 and 32 bit
	units. Based on patch from Warren Jasper <warrenj@bops.com>.

2001-12-05  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c (get_config): If we are editing an IP address, and
	it is 0.0.0.0 (as you get at "fco -i" time) suppress using that as
	the initial value of the string, it is unhelpful as a starting
	point for line editing.

	If we were given a value on the CLI eg. "fco bootp false" because
	the new value was copied into the holding string, it was not
	recognized as a change, so the flash was not updated.  Bug!  The
	fix is to change the order of the strcpy()s so that holdline is
	before line.

	If the input line for a new value is completely blank, and the
	type is not string, take this to mean don't change the value.
	Otherwise typing in an empty line to an IP address goes off and
	tries to DNS resolve it there and then, looks like a hang.

	(do_flash_config): If we print the message "** invalid entry" do
	not just loop; set onevalue = NULL so that the user is prompted
	for a good value.  Otherwise it loops forever trying the same
	value if you typed "fco bootp goat" (goat being a bad boolean).

	* src/parse.c (parse_bool): Check for (partial) rest of the word
	either "true" or "false" and nothing extra.  Thus we reject
	"truefalse" as is all to easy to type in by accident.  "TRU" "T"
	"tRuE" are all OK of course.

	* src/net/inet_addr.c (inet_aton): Do not accept terminating the
	dot-quad address with a final dot.  Else typing on the end of a
	provided-for-editing string is accepted.  Also reject units > 255.
	Allow typing in either exactly one (large) number or 4 small ones;
	reject intermediates.  Thus we reject "10.16.19.1110.16.19.33" and
	"0.0.0.010.16.19.11" as are all to easy to type in by accident,
	and things like 10.0.0xffff which used to be accepted.  0x0a00ffff
	is OK though.  This change also prevents the pointer s running off
	the end of the string if you just entered eg. "1".

2001-12-04  Richard Sandiford  <rsandifo@redhat.com>

	* include/net/net.h (ETH_MAX_PKTLEN): Increase to match definition
	of MAX_ETH_MSG.

2001-12-04  Richard Sandiford  <rsandifo@redhat.com>

	* src/net/tcp.c (__tcp_poll): Call MS_TICKS_DELAY before __timer_poll.
	* src/net/net_io.c (net_io_getc): Remove MS_TICKS_DELAY from here...
	(net_io_getc_nonblock): ...and from here.

2001-11-30  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/net/net_io.c (net_init): Print ESA for device even if bootp
	fails.

2001-11-29  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/net/dns.c: Rename index -> ptdindex to avoid conflict with BSD
	index() function.

2001-11-29  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/net/tftp_client.c (tftp_stream_open): Clear from_addr's
	sin_port so multiple loads are possible.

2001-11-26  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* misc/redboot_XXX.ecm: Added. Replaced the _RAM, _ROM, and
	_ROMRAM variants.

	* misc/redboot_ROM.ecm: Added configuration with all packages
	relevant for a full RedBoot configuration. Whenever new (optional)
	RedBoot peer packages are added, they should be added to these
	files and not the RedBoot template.
	* misc/redboot_ROMRAM.ecm: Same.
	* misc/redboot_RAM.ecm: Same.

2001-11-15  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/redboot.h: Added load_address and load_address_end
	variables to hold bounds of a loaded image.
	* src/load.c: Fill load_address and load_address_end after srec
	and binary loads.
	* src/flash.c: Same.
	* src/main.c (do_go): removed unneeded cast.

2001-11-14  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/io.c (_rb_gets_preloaded): More correct timeout handling.
	n.b. in practice, this changes nothing, but it is more "correct".

2001-11-05  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/load.c: Minor typo in help string.

	* src/io.c (_rb_gets_preloaded): Clear buffer if ^C.

2001-11-02  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c (fis_init): Fix warning.

2001-11-01  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c (fis_init): tweaks to the SIB protection code.

2001-11-01  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c (fis_init): Need to init block fully, otherwise old
	images can persist after init.

2001-10-31  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/sib.h: Contains information about ARM Boot Monitor flash
	block information.

	* cdl/redboot.cdl: Added CYGOPT_REDBOOT_FIS_DIRECTORY_ARM_SIB_ID
	option.

	* src/flash.c (fis_init): Added code to add ARM Boot Monitor
	footer on FIS block.
	
2001-10-30  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c (fis_delete): Prototype arm_fis_delete in correct place.
	(fis_list): Fix compilation problem - this isn't C++!

2001-10-30  Philippe Robin <Philippe.Robin@arm.com>
2001-10-30  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>
	
	* cdl/redboot.cdl: Add CYGINT_REDBOOT_ARM_FLASH_SIB_SUPPORTED and
	CYGHWR_REDBOOT_ARM_FLASH_SIB to indicate support for, and a request
	to provide ARM flash block structure support.

	* src/flash.c (fis_list): Call out to driver for ARM block FIS listing.
	(fis_delete): Call out to driver for ARM block FIS deletion.

2001-10-29  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/main.c (cyg_start): New pseudo-commands, useful for scripts.
	'# anything' - treated like a comment.
	'= anything' - comment, but prints command line on console.

	* src/flash.c (expand_aliases): Don't expand aliases which are
	quoted, but only on the command line.  This allows aliases to
	expand into other aliases which are within quoted strings.

	* include/redboot.h: 
	* src/io.c (_rb_gets_preloaded): New function which allows for a
	buffer to be displayed and edited in place.  This is extremely
	useful for 'fconfig', now that better line editing functions are
	supported.

	* src/flash.c (get_config): Using new function _rb_gets_preloaded(),
	which supports edit-in-place for data items.

2001-10-28  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/main.c (cyg_start): 
	* src/io.c (_rb_gets): 
	* include/redboot.h: Add new global control 'cmd_history' which is
	used to enable/disable command history collection.  This keeps the
	history from being cluttered with things like 'y' (answers to simple
	questions).

2001-10-26  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/io.c (_rb_gets): Fix ^A editing - was timing out, thus erasing
	buffer [silently].

2001-10-25  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/io.c:
	* cdl/redboot.cdl: Add command line history and edit functions.
	Controlled by CYGNUM_REDBOOT_CMD_LINE_EDITING option which defines
	the depth of the history buffer.

2001-10-22  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/redboot.h: Declare net_debug here.

2001-10-18  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/net/net_io.c (net_init): Set cyg_io_eth_net_debug from net_debug.
	* include/net/net.h: Declare cyg_io_eth_net_debug.

2001-10-18  David Howells  <dhowells@redhat.com>

	* src/syscall.c: Added support for the times() syscall and marked
	the utime() syscall as being implemented incorrectly.

2001-10-18  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/io.c (_rb_gets): Fix parsing of \" in strings.

2001-10-16  Jesper Skov  <jskov@zoftcorp.adsl.dk>

2001-10-16  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/net/dns.c (send_recv): Clear from_addr before passing it to
	__udp_recvfrom. Fixed return value.

2001-10-16  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c (_do_flash_init): 
	Add wrapper function for do_flash_init() to avoid compiler warning.

	* src/io.c (_rb_gets): 
	Use sub-timeouts when calling mon_read_char_with_timeout() as it
	was intended that this routine should timeout quickly to allow
	for other processing to take place if no data is available.  In
	practice this won't make any difference unless the global "idle"
	timeout value is changed to be something quite large.

	* src/decompress.c: Improve memory allocators.  Also use 'init'
	style function so that this is the only file that knows anything
	of the details of the decompression process or packaging.

	* src/main.c: 
	* include/redboot.h: 
	* cdl/redboot.cdl: Rework decompression to be totally encapsulated.
	This keeps the details of this functionality in a single file, rather
	than scattered throughout RedBoot.

2001-10-15  David Howells  <dhowells@redhat.com>

	* src/xyzModem.c: put semicolon between goto-label and close curly.

2001-10-15  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c (_expand_aliases): Change around some ambiguous code.

	* src/main.c: 
	* src/decompress.c: 
	* include/redboot.h: 
	* cdl/redboot.cdl: Provide RedBoot specific memory allocators
	for ZLIB.  Allows much finer control over memory map.

	* src/main.c (do_dump): Add option "-s" to dump data as S-records.

2001-10-11  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/net/enet.c (__enet_poll): Suppress warning messages.

2001-10-10  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c (do_flash_init): Only set __flash_init when init is
	successful.

2001-10-04  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/fs/disk.c: Fix ISO9660 build error.

	* src/main.c: Added x as an alias for the dump command.

	* src/net/dns.c: Fixed some messages (DNS -> DNS server).

2001-10-02  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/xyzModem.h: 
	* src/xyzModem.c (xyzModem_stream_open): 
	* src/load.c (do_load): Add new option "-c <N>" to let the user
	specify the I/O channel to use - xyModem only.

2001-10-01  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/net/udp.c (__udp_recvfrom): Don't change server address (returned
	by this function) until a packet has been received with no timeout.

2001-09-28  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c (fis_create): if not copying, still update directory.

2001-09-28  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c (_expand_aliases): Properly null terminate expanded 
	string - failed if alias was at end of line.

2001-09-27  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/net/dns.c: Include tracing header.

2001-09-26  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/net/dns.c: Removed errno hacks.
	Reduce size of string buffers. Make sure they suffice (or fail).

	* include/redboot.h: Added DNS h_errno definitions.

	* include/redboot.h: Fix for building on targets wo network.

	* src/load.c (do_load): Make sure host can be reached - and print
	appropriate error message if not.

	* src/net/net_io.c (net_init): Call DNS init when appropriate.

	* src/net/inet_addr.c (inet_aton): Made s argument const.

	* src/net/dns.c: Added UDP driven DNS support.

	* src/net/bootp.c: Fixed warnings.

	* src/flash.c: Replaced inet_aton with _gethostbyname.
	* src/load.c: Same.
	* src/net/ping.c: Same.

	* include/net/net.h: Fix warning.

	* include/redboot.h: Added DNS stuff, including some string
	helpers.

	* cdl/redboot.cdl: Added DNS support options.

2001-09-14  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/version.c: Simplify _CERTIFICATE handling.

2001-09-13  Fabrice Gautier <Fabrice_Gautier@sdesigns.com>

	* cdl/redboot.cdl: Added configuration options to deactivate BOOTP and
	enable net debug.
	* src/net/net_io.c (net_init): Use them.

2001-09-13  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c: Cleanups - removing some redundant code.

2001-09-12  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

        * src/flash.c (do_flash_init): Only allocate fis block when
        CYGOPT_REDBOOT_FIS enabled.
        Conditionalize fis_work_block and fisdir_size.

2001-09-12  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

        * src/flash.c (load_flash_config): Use additional space in the
        FLASH work area (at end of RAM) for 'fconfig' data.  This reduces
        overall stack requirements as there is no need for 'fconfig' data
        to be held on the stack anymore.

        * src/flash.c: 
        * include/fis.h: Define flash addresses using CYG_ADDRESS which
        is more portable than (unsigned long).

2001-09-11  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

        * cdl/redboot.cdl (CYGPKG_REDBOOT_FLASH): Be conditional on an
        actual flash device, not just the generic flash layer.

2001-09-11  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

        * src/version.c (_CERTIFICATE): Add information about product
        certification (either Red Hat certified or not).

        * src/flash.c (fis_delete): Deny user deleting "reserved" images.

2001-09-07  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>
	* src/flash.c: Extend the alias handling to allow configuration
	information to be access using alias. Fixed alias expansion
	when the alias is bigger than the replacement.
	* src/parse.c: A semi colon can be used to separate multiple
	commands on one line. 
	
2001-09-06  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/redboot.h: Include string function prototype header.

2001-09-06  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/fs/ide.c (ide_read_sectors): Use diag_(s)printf.
	* src/fs/disk.c (do_disks): Same.

2001-08-27  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>
	* src/flash.c: Allow the flash blocks used for FIS directory and
	config information to be user configured. Generalise the fis_init
	function to deal with the blocks in any order.
	* cdl/redboot.cdl: Added the configury needed to specify which
	flash blocks to use.
	
2001-08-27  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/syscall.c (HZ): Should be 60 for ARM, also.

2001-08-24  Tim Smith  <tsmith@redhat.com>
	* src/xyzModem.c
	* src/xyzModem.h
	Provide xyzModem_stream_terminate() function to abort/clean up
	XYZmodem download on normal termination or after errors.

	* src/load.c
	Use aforementioned function to abort downloads on SREC errors,
	stop load_srec_image() from injecting stuff into the XYZmodem
	stream and confusing things.

2001-08-24  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/net/net_io.c: Don't close connections if there is
	data left to read or write.

	* src/syscall.c: Add support for utimes syscall.

2001-08-22  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/net/udp.c:

	printf() is no longer a part of RedBoot.  Thus all programs
	must use diag_printf() and related functions instead.  Also
	renamed the non-standard function gets() to be _rb_gets()
	since there was some confusion about it because of it's
	rather standard name.

	* cdl/redboot.cdl: Lots of changes based on moving all printf()
	functionality into "infra" and only using it as diag_XXX().

	particular, handle case where FLASH block size is too small
	to hold fconfig data.

	* src/io.c (mon_set_read_char_timeout): Fix dangling else bug.

	* src/flash.c (do_flash_init): Suppress printing info - this

	configured in (but flash support still is present).

	* src/version.c: Display complete version information which 
	reflects such information as the source release, etc.

	* cdl/redboot.cdl: New option CYGDAT_REDBOOT_CUSTOM_VERSION used to

             user_value 1 "Special test version"
           };

	as it should be if you made a change.

2001-03-29  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

2001-03-15  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c (fis_create): The code was installing a default for
	img_size from data_length of an extant record.  That's zero, so,
	so whilst the flash was erased, no data was copied in!
	(fis_list): Added a -d to get the data length field displayed.

2001-03-15  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/main.c: Make use of script variable conditional on flash.

	versions, e.g. script timeout.  Also, allow a script to continue
	if it was in effect when 'go' was called and ^C was typed.

	if any [important] parameters are being assumed [left out by user].
	This just adds a level of safety in the presence of assumptions.

2001-03-13  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/main.c: Define 'workspace' based on MLT files, rather than
	simply using end of RAM area.

	* src/flash.c: Use 'workspace' for scratch area.

	* include/redboot.h: Define new variables 'workspace_XXX' to specify
	ares used by RedBoot for scratch, etc.

2001-03-12  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/decompress.c: Removed Z_BAD_CRC hack. zlib does CRC checking
	now.

2001-03-09  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/misc_funs.c: Added strncpy.
	* include/redboot.h: And declaration.

2001-03-08  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/load.c (do_load): Added decompression support.
	* src/flash.c (fis_load): Same.

	* src/decompress.c: Added. Interfaces the zlib API.

	* include/redboot.h: Added some definitions used by decompression
	code.

	* cdl/redboot.cdl: Added option to control size of zlib bounce
	buffer.

2001-03-05  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/main.c (cyg_start): Make sure communication channels are
	initialized.

2001-03-03  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/main.c (do_idle): New function - all 'idle' handling is here.

	* src/io.c (mon_read_char_with_timeout): Improve timeout handling
	when scanning for a console by applying the minimum possible value
	(1 ms) to each channel, accumulating the total value.  The previous
	algorithm was quite poor on systems where there is no buffering,
	i.e. serial channels with no FIFOs, because each channel would 
	wait for T/N (t = total timeout, N = number channels).  This might
	possibly have been much longer than the devices could tolerate and
	still return valid data.

2001-03-01  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/version.c: Add 'bootstrap' to banner so the world can see
	more of what RedBoot's all about.

2001-02-28  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/redboot.h: Fix prioritization of 'init' table entries.

2001-02-26  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/redboot.h (RedBoot_INIT_PRIO): Slight change - avoid
	arithmetic which C preprocessor doesn't handle anyway.  This also
	fixes prioritizing init entries.

	* src/flash.c (fis_load): Only load actual data [length] when loading
	an image.  

	* cdl/redboot.cdl: Change build rule to always rebuild 'version.o'
	whenever the application is relinked.  Thus the version string will
	always accurately reflect the actual build date/time.

2001-02-22  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* cdl/redboot.cdl: New config options to control default creation
	of various FIS image files.  Also opt for a reserved area at the
	base of flash, eg. for user's POST or other pre-RedBoot code that
	we must not interfere with.  This isn't the same as the extant
	boot_offset option, so the two are made to work together.
	Likewise an offset for the start of a POST-cooperative RedBoot
	image, if any; the value is of course platform dependent, not
	simply after the first RedBoot image, if there is one.

	Clarification: a POST-cooperative RedBoot image is a ROM-start
	image that runs at a higher address in ROM, and which omits some
	of the hardware initialization because it's already done by
	whatever came before.  Most targets do not have such a thing;
	those that do, it is created by a config export file, not by a new
	startup type.  A POST Redboot can be tested from a plain ROM
	redboot by just calling its entrypoint once it is installed in
	flash; eg. by "go 0x50040044" at the RedBoot prompt.

	* src/flash.c (fis_init): Create additional optional entries for
	  o (reserved) reserved area at start, for preboot or post code.
	  o RedBoot itself now optional
	  o RedBoot[post]
	  o RedBoot[backup]
	Also initialize their addresses, sizes, accordingly.
	The default behaviour is unchanged.
	The flash erase is moved to after the fis table init because the
	fis table init most conveniently calculates the high water mark of
	built-in default objects.
	(fis_create): If creating a file which already exists (most likely
	one of the preconfigured defaults) pick up Flash address and
	length (the two required parameters) from there.  They're required
	to be the same to it's no loss of generality, and saves typing,
	makes the default entries far more useful and so on.
	(fis_delete): Skip those entries which were
	preconfigured; we want nobody to be able to delete these.
	(fis_free): Start searching for free space to list only after the
	reserved base area - if there is one.
	(fis_find_free): Start searching for free space only after the
	reserved base area...

2001-02-22  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/io.c (dump_buf_with_offset): Clean up warnings.

	* src/net/net_io.c: Cosmetic - clean up TCP debug code.

	* src/main.c (cmd_search): Search for ambiguous commands was
	wrong since layout change (only know the limits, don't rely
	on "null" entry).

2000-08-14  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/redboot.cdl: Support for plugin (table driven) modules.

	* src/flash.c: Lots of warning cleanups.

	latency).  Additional small changes to support network debug.

2000-07-30  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c: Make config data safer with a 'key'.  Also, don't
	erase the config data when doing a full FIS initialization.

	* src/redboot.h: Make command parsing functions public.

2000-07-29  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/net/bootp.c: Turn on network debug during address discovery.
	(Note: this will be optional/configurable in the future).

	* src/redboot.h: 
	* src/main.c: 
	* src/io.c: 
	* src/net/net_io.c: Support "floating" console, chosen from
	available serial I/O channels.

2000-07-26  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/net/tftp_support.h: 
	* src/net/tftp_client.c: Add new stream oriented functions.

	* src/net/net.h: More prototypes.

	* src/redboot.h: Move support functions here.  Update interfaces.

2000-07-22  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/main.c (do_load): Add proper argument parsing.

2000-07-21  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/io.c (gets): Treat "\n\r" and "\r\n" as exactluy "\n".  This
	solves problems of simply ignoring "\n" on terminals which can only
	send that character while still working with telnet/TCP connections.

	* src/net/net_io.c: New file.  Supports local I/O via a TCP channel.
	Additional changes to support TCP channel for GDB debug I/O.

	* cdl/redboot.cdl: Clean up dependencies.  Extend network configuration.

	* src/io.c (gets): Ignore blank lines which contain only '\n'.
	This works fine for terminal I/O since they will have '\r' and it
	allows reasonable handling when connected via telnet/TCP.

	* src/main.c: Better support for network connections.  
	Also some reworking of FLASH routines [will be moved later].  
	More error checking and better error messages in download code.

	* src/net/net.h: Reorder 'tcp_socket' fields to enforce proper
	alignment of data buffer [needs to be on dword boundary].

	* src/net/tcp.c: Many small changes getting 'endian'-ness correct.

	* src/net/tftp_client.c (tftp_error): New function - returns a
	string representing the error code [for humans].

2000-07-16  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/redboot.cdl: Make network support configurable/optional.

	* src/io.c: Add command line input function.

	* src/main.c: Lots of new functions, command line processing, etc.

	* src/misc_funs.c (strcmp, strncmp): New function(s).	

	* src/printf.c: Add support for "%p" (pointers).

	* src/redboot.h: Expand, move global vars, here, etc.

	* src/net/eth_drv.c: Make quieter, change "no interface" string.

	* src/net/net.h (__LITTLE_ENDIAN__): Avoid redefining this on platforms
	where GCC does it for us.

2000-07-12  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/redboot.cdl: New file(s).
