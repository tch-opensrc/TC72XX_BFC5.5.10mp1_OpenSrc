	* docs/notes.txt:
	Notes added to describe what has and has not been done here.

	* docs/i386.default.ld:
	A lightly edited version of the default linker script for Linux
	executables. See notes.txt for what this is for.

	* cdl/loader.cdl:
	Added support for dlxxx() API functions.
	Various modifications to make rules for various things - these are
	only guranteed to work for the linux synthetic target at present.

	* src/crtbeginS.c: 
	* src/crtendS.c:
	Tidied and made to work (for synthetic target only).

	* include/loader.hxx:
	* src/loader.cxx:
	Lots of changes as a result of implementation efforts.

	* include/i386_elf.h:
	Implemented relocations. Added Linker script customizations.

	* include/elf.h:
	Removed buckchain[] array from Elf_Hash structure.

	* include/dlfcn.h:
	Implementation header for the dlxxx() functions.

	* src/dload.cxx:
	Implementation of the dlxxx() functions.
	
	* include/mips_elf.h:
	* include/arm_elf.h:
	ARM support header added. MIPS support header made compilable.
	These are both still incomplete.

	* src/dynamic.ld: Regenerated by copying and editing Linux script
	for shared libraries.

	* tests/loadfoo.cxx:
	Some test infrastructure added and modified to use dlxxx()
	functions. Needs more tidying.
