	* cdl/microwindows.cdl: There's no docs so don't supply CDL.

2002-04-30  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* cdl/microwindows.cdl:
	Replace description properties with display properties.

2002-04-26  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* src/drivers/scr_ecospcsvga.c:
	New screen driver for PC hardware.

	* src/nanox/srvmain.c:
	Change #ifdef's for new PC screen driver

	* src/nanox/clientfb.c:
	Get a framebuffer address for x86 hardware

	* src/ecos/ecos_app.c:
	Only build keyboard widget when needed. PC hardware has a real
	keyboard. 

	* cdl/microwindows.cdl:
	Add configuration options for PC graphics. Automatically
	build the files which instantiate eCos threads for the various
	microwindows applications.

2002-04-15  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/demos/nanox/world.c (MAPFILE): Load from current directory.

2002-04-12  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* src/nanox/srvmain.c:
	Use a new main loop for PC/VGA. The default loop with
	networking enabled assumes you can select() on the
	mouse and keyboard, which is not currently implemented.

	* src/ecos/ecos_init.c:
	Add some conditional compilation. Only check for
	a logo file when there is a file system. Don't bother
	with touchscreen calibration on a PC without a
	touch-sensitive screen.

	* cdl/microwindows.cdl:
	Add configury for building on a PC.

	* src/drivers/ps2kbdmou_ecos.c:
	Driver for PC PS/2 keyboard and mouse. Only tested against
	a Japanese Dell Inspiron laptop.

2002-04-12  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/drivers/scr_ecos.c (gen_getscreeninfo): Return proper
	fbdriver ptr.
	(set_portrait_mode): Update psd->portrait variable.

	* src/demos/nanox/world.c: Removed load hack. Problem was due to
	truncated jffs2 fs.

2002-04-10  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/microwin/nano-X.h: Silence warning by including kapi.h

2002-04-08  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/microwindows.cdl: Build Map demo if required. Require it for
	the ARM targets.

	* src/demos/nanox/world.c (load): Hacked to do nothing.
	(main): renamed to app_main.

2002-03-27  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/drivers/scr_ecos.c (gen_getscreeninfo): Fill in correct
	color layout based on pixel format. Now the animation renders
	correctly.

	* drivers/scr_ecos.c (gen_getscreeninfo): Fill in all
	parameters. At least the missing potrait mode cause
	problems. fbdriver parameter is probably wrong, but needs to be
	non-zero.

2002-03-26  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/microwindows.cdl: Renamed CYGBLD_MICROWINDOWS_ARM9_DRIVERS
	to CYGBLD_MICROWINDOWS_ARM_DRIVERS and added ipaq/aaed hacks.

	* Moved sources to services/gfx/mw with help from Gary. Moved
	src/include directory to include/microwin.

	* cdl/microwindows.cdl: Added CDL build	support.
	* src/demos/nanowm/nanowm.c: Rename main() for eCos builds.
	* src/demos/nxkbd/nxkbd.c: Same.
	* src/nanox/srvmain.c: Same.

	* src/ecos/ecos_init.c: Fix some warnings, use redhat.logo for IO
	testing.
	
2002-03-22  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* Configs/config.ecosvga:
	New config file for eCos on a PC using the VGA driver.

	* Arc.rules, makefile.rules, config, */Makefile */*/Makefile
	Add build support for x86 eCos, and allow builds outside the
	source tree.
	
	* nanox/clientfb.c:
	Only assume LCD display when compiling for ARM.
	<cyg/hal/lcd_support.h> etc. do not exist when building for PC.

	* ecos/ecos_app.c:
	Add missing #include's
	Fix type ecos_nx_setup() vs. ecos_nx_init()

	* drivers/vgaplan4.h:
	Define the appropriate out?() macros for eCos

	* drivers/vgainit.c:
	Set up to access hardware directly. 
	Use HAL macro to peek I/O port
	Fix one of the initial values for the VGA registers, which I
	believe was leaving all planes disabled.
	
	* drivers/scr_ecos.c:
	This is not used by all eCos targets, e.g. PC using the
	microwindows VGA driver. For now conditionalize on CYGPKG_HAL_ARM. 

	* drivers/memplan4.c, drivers/scr_bios.c, 
	Set up to access hardware directly under eCos.

	* drivers/kbd_null.c:
	Declaration of NUL_Read() did not match definition.

2002-03-14  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* Makefile: Fix typo.

	* nanox/Makefile: Build clientfb.c
	* nanox/clientfb.c: Hacked for eCos.

	* nanox/client.c (nxErrorStrings): Define for eCos.
	* nanox/srvevent.c (nxErrorStrings): Don't define for eCos.

2002-03-13  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* ecos/Makefile: Require 'DEMO=Y' and 'AGDEMO=Y' to build old or
	agdemo respectively.
	* ecos/ecos_app.c: Wrap img_demo stuff in USE_IMG_DEMO.

	* ecos/img_demo.c: Added. (older version)

	* Makefile.rules (clean): Don't blow away everything if there's no
	bin directory.

	* Makefile: Added ecos build rule. Create bin and lib.

	* Makefile.rules (CPPFLAGS): Include $(INCLUDEDIRS) for proper
	dependencies on ecos headers.

	* ecos/ecos_init.c (ecos_nx_init): Use portrait_right mode for
	IPAQ.
	* drivers/scr_ecos.c (set_portrait_mode): Added. Cleaned up
	portrait switch handling.

	* ChangeLog.MW: Moved the original ChangeLog to ChangeLog.MW

	Changes made by Gary Thomas <gthomas@redhat.com>. Diff against
	branch MW_0_89_pre8:
	* src/Arch.rules: Updated for building ag_demo.

	screen pixel type. Also added JPEG support and disabled potrait
