2001-05-02  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/dlmalloc.cxx (Cyg_Mempool_dlmalloc_Implementation): Fix
	previous change; "top" is a pseudo variable via a NULL pointer if
	the heap is not initialized, so you can't use it as a flag for "no
	mem here"; and a typo, the comparison was reversed.  The two hid
	each other, so the check for "no mem here" usually said "OK".

	* tests/realloc.c (main): fix warning.
	* tests/malloc1.c (main): Same.
	* tests/malloc2.c (main): Same.

	var in each thread.

2000-07-25  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* tests/malloc4.cxx (thrfree): Get mem size here. Tidy output.

	Created as new package, merging existing memory allocator related stuff
	from the kernel and libc. Many bug fixes to existing stuff, as
	well as performance improvements, and extra features such as
	a port of dlmalloc, and the ability to support multiple disjoint
	heaps, possibly with run-time configurable size.
	There's even a bit of documentation, and some new tests
