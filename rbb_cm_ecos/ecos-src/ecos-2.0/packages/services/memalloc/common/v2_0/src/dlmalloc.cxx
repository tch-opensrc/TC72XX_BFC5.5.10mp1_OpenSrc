// Purpose:      Doug Lea's malloc implementation
// Description:  Doug Lea's malloc has been ported to eCos. This file
//               provides the implementation in a way acceptable to eCos.
//               Substantial amounts of unnecessary bits (to eCos) of the
//               original implementation have been removed to make the
//               code more tractable. Note this may make a number of the
//               comments appear to make little sense, or no longer apply!
//               In particular, mmap support is removed entirely.
//               Also the memory is "sbrked" all at once at the
//               beginning, covering the entire memory region given at
//               construction, and there can be no more afterwards.
// Usage:        #include <cyg/memalloc/dlmalloc.hxx>

/* 
  A version of malloc/free/realloc written by Doug Lea and released to the 
  public domain.  Send questions/comments/complaints/performance data
  to dl at cs.oswego.edu

* VERSION 2.6.6  Sun Mar  5 19:10:03 2000  Doug Lea  (dl at gee)
  
   Note: There may be an updated version of this malloc obtainable at
           ftp://g.oswego.edu/pub/misc/malloc.c
         Check before installing!

* Why use this malloc?

  This is not the fastest, most space-conserving, most portable, or
  most tunable malloc ever written. However it is among the fastest
  while also being among the most space-conserving, portable and tunable.
  Consistent balance across these factors results in a good general-purpose 
  allocator. For a high-level description, see 
     http://g.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html

* Synopsis of public routines

  (Much fuller descriptions are contained in the program documentation below.)

[ these have of course been renamed in the eCos port ]a

  malloc(size_t n);
     Return a pointer to a newly allocated chunk of at least n bytes, or null
     if no space is available.
  free(Void_t* p);
     Release the chunk of memory pointed to by p, or no effect if p is null.
  realloc(Void_t* p, size_t n);
     Return a pointer to a chunk of size n that contains the same data
     as does chunk p up to the minimum of (n, p's size) bytes, or null
     if no space is available. The returned pointer may or may not be
     the same as p. If p is null, equivalent to malloc. realloc of
     zero bytes calls free(p)

* Vital statistics:

  Alignment:                            8-byte
       8 byte alignment is currently hardwired into the design.  This
       seems to suffice for all current machines and C compilers.

  Assumed pointer representation:       4 or 8 bytes
       Code for 8-byte pointers is untested by me but has worked
       reliably by Wolfram Gloger, who contributed most of the
       changes supporting this.

  Assumed size_t  representation:       4 or 8 bytes
       Note that size_t is allowed to be 4 bytes even if pointers are 8.        

  Minimum overhead per allocated chunk: 4 or 8 bytes
       Each malloced chunk has a hidden overhead of 4 bytes holding size
       and status information.  

  Minimum allocated size: 4-byte ptrs:  16 bytes    (including 4 overhead)
                          8-byte ptrs:  24/32 bytes (including, 4/8 overhead)
                                     
       When a chunk is freed, 12 (for 4byte ptrs) or 20 (for 8 byte
       ptrs but 4 byte size) or 24 (for 8/8) additional bytes are 
       needed; 4 (8) for a trailing size field
       and 8 (16) bytes for free list pointers. Thus, the minimum
       allocatable size is 16/24/32 bytes.

       Even a request for zero bytes (i.e., malloc(0)) returns a
       pointer to something of the minimum allocatable size.

  Maximum allocated size: 4-byte size_t: 2^31 -  8 bytes
                          8-byte size_t: 2^63 - 16 bytes

       It is assumed that (possibly signed) size_t bit values suffice to
       represent chunk sizes. `Possibly signed' is due to the fact
       that `size_t' may be defined on a system as either a signed or
       an unsigned type. To be conservative, values that would appear
       as negative numbers are avoided.  
       Requests for sizes with a negative sign bit when the request
       size is treaded as a long will return null.

  Maximum overhead wastage per allocated chunk: normally 15 bytes

       Alignnment demands, plus the minimum allocatable size restriction
       make the normal worst-case wastage 15 bytes (i.e., up to 15
       more bytes will be allocated than were requested in malloc), with 
       one exception: because requests for zero bytes allocate non-zero space,
       the worst case wastage for a request of zero bytes is 24 bytes.

* Limitations

    Here are some features that are NOT currently supported

    * No user-definable hooks for callbacks and the like.
    * No automated mechanism for fully checking that all accesses
      to malloced memory stay within their bounds.
    * No support for compaction.

* Synopsis of compile-time options:

    People have reported using previous versions of this malloc on all
    versions of Unix, sometimes by tweaking some of the defines
    below. It has been tested most extensively on Solaris and
    Linux. It is also reported to work on WIN32 platforms.
    People have also reported adapting this malloc for use in
    stand-alone embedded systems.

    The implementation is in straight, hand-tuned ANSI C.  Among other
    consequences, it uses a lot of macros.  Because of this, to be at
    all usable, this code should be compiled using an optimizing compiler
    (for example gcc -O2) that can simplify expressions and control
    paths.

  CYGDBG_MEMALLOC_ALLOCATOR_DLMALLOC_DEBUG      (default: NOT defined)
     Define to enable debugging. Adds fairly extensive assertion-based 
     checking to help track down memory errors, but noticeably slows down
     execution.
  MALLOC_LOCK		   (default: NOT defined)
  MALLOC_UNLOCK		   (default: NOT defined)
     Define these to C expressions which are run to lock and unlock
     the malloc data structures.  Calls may be nested; that is,
     MALLOC_LOCK may be called more than once before the corresponding
     MALLOC_UNLOCK calls.  MALLOC_LOCK must avoid waiting for a lock
     that it already holds.
  MALLOC_ALIGNMENT          (default: NOT defined)
     Define this to 16 if you need 16 byte alignment instead of 8 byte alignment
     which is the normal default.
  SIZE_T_SMALLER_THAN_LONG (default: NOT defined)
     Define this when the platform you are compiling has
     sizeof(long) > sizeof(size_t).
     The option causes some extra code to be generated to handle operations
     that use size_t operands and have long results.
  INTERNAL_SIZE_T           (default: size_t)
     Define to a 32-bit type (probably `unsigned int') if you are on a
     64-bit machine, yet do not want or need to allow malloc requests of
     greater than 2^31 to be handled. This saves space, especially for
     very small chunks.

/*
    Debugging:

    Because freed chunks may be overwritten with link fields, this
    malloc will often die when freed memory is overwritten by user
    programs.  This can be very effective (albeit in an annoying way)
    in helping track down dangling pointers.

    If you compile with CYGDBG_MEMALLOC_ALLOCATOR_DLMALLOC_DEBUG enabled, a
    number of assertion checks are
    enabled that will catch more memory errors. You probably won't be
    able to make much sense of the actual assertion errors, but they
    should help you locate incorrectly overwritten memory.  The
    checking is fairly extensive, and will slow down execution
    noticeably. Calling get_status() with DEBUG set will
    attempt to check every allocated and free chunk in the
    course of computing the summmaries. 

    Setting CYGDBG_MEMALLOC_ALLOCATOR_DLMALLOC_DEBUG may also be helpful if you
    are trying to modify this code. The assertions in the check routines
    spell out in more detail the assumptions and invariants underlying
    the algorithms.

  2^31. This limitation is hardly ever a concern; you are encouraged

  Following is needed on implementations whereby long > size_t.
  The problem is caused because the code performs subtractions of
  size_t values and stores the result in long values.  In the case
  where long > size_t and the first value is actually less than
  the second value, the resultant value is positive.  For example,
  (long)(x - y) where x = 0 and y is 1 ends up being 0x00000000FFFFFFFF
  which is 2*31 - 1 instead of 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF.  This is due to the
  fact that assignment from unsigned to signed won't sign extend.

/*
   malloc_chunk details:

    (The following includes lightly edited explanations by Colin Plumb.)

    Chunks of memory are maintained using a `boundary tag' method as
    described in e.g., Knuth or Standish.  (See the paper by Paul
    Wilson ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/garbage/allocsrv.ps for a
    survey of such techniques.)  Sizes of free chunks are stored both
    in the front of each chunk and at the end.  This makes
    consolidating fragmented chunks into bigger chunks very fast.  The
    size fields also hold bits representing whether chunks are free or
    in use.

    An allocated chunk looks like this:  


    chunk-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |             Size of previous chunk, if allocated            | |
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |             Size of chunk, in bytes                         |P|
      mem-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |             User data starts here...                          .
            .                                                               .
            .             (malloc_usable_space() bytes)                     .
            .                                                               |
nextchunk-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |             Size of chunk                                     |
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


    Where "chunk" is the front of the chunk for the purpose of most of
    the malloc code, but "mem" is the pointer that is returned to the
    user.  "Nextchunk" is the beginning of the next contiguous chunk.

    Chunks always begin on even word boundries, so the mem portion
    (which is returned to the user) is also on an even word boundary, and
    thus double-word aligned.

    Free chunks are stored in circular doubly-linked lists, and look like this:

    chunk-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |             Size of previous chunk                            |
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    `head:' |             Size of chunk, in bytes                         |P|
      mem-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |             Forward pointer to next chunk in list             |
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |             Back pointer to previous chunk in list            |
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |             Unused space (may be 0 bytes long)                .
            .                                                               .
            .                                                               |
nextchunk-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    `foot:' |             Size of chunk, in bytes                           |
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

    The P (PREV_INUSE) bit, stored in the unused low-order bit of the
    chunk size (which is always a multiple of two words), is an in-use
    bit for the *previous* chunk.  If that bit is *clear*, then the
    word before the current chunk size contains the previous chunk
    size, and can be used to find the front of the previous chunk.
    (The very first chunk allocated always has this bit set,
    preventing access to non-existent (or non-owned) memory.)

    Note that the `foot' of the current chunk is actually represented
    as the prev_size of the NEXT chunk. (This makes it easier to
    deal with alignments etc).

    The exception to all this is the special chunk `top', which doesn't
    bother using the trailing size field since there is no next
    contiguous chunk that would have to index off it. (After
    initialization, `top' is forced to always exist. )

    Available chunks are kept in any of several places (all declared below):

    * `av': An array of chunks serving as bin headers for consolidated
       chunks. Each bin is doubly linked.  The bins are approximately
       proportionally (log) spaced.  There are a lot of these bins
       (128). This may look excessive, but works very well in
       practice.  All procedures maintain the invariant that no
       consolidated chunk physically borders another one. Chunks in
       bins are kept in size order, with ties going to the
       approximately least recently used chunk.

       The chunks in each bin are maintained in decreasing sorted order by
       size.  This is irrelevant for the small bins, which all contain
       the same-sized chunks, but facilitates best-fit allocation for
       larger chunks. (These lists are just sequential. Keeping them in
       order almost never requires enough traversal to warrant using
       fancier ordered data structures.)  Chunks of the same size are
       linked with the most recently freed at the front, and allocations
       are taken from the back.  This results in LRU or FIFO allocation
       order, which tends to give each chunk an equal opportunity to be
       consolidated with adjacent freed chunks, resulting in larger free
       chunks and less fragmentation. 

    * `top': The top-most available chunk (i.e., the one bordering the
       end of available memory) is treated specially. It is never
       included in any bin, is used only if no other chunk is
       available.

    * `last_remainder': A bin holding only the remainder of the
       most recently split (non-top) chunk. This bin is checked
       before other non-fitting chunks, so as to provide better
       locality for runs of sequentially allocated chunks.

   Bins

    The bins, `av_' are an array of pairs of pointers serving as the
    heads of (initially empty) doubly-linked lists of chunks, laid out
    in a way so that each pair can be treated as if it were in a
    malloc_chunk. (This way, the fd/bk offsets for linking bin heads
    and chunks are the same).

    Bins for sizes < 512 bytes contain chunks of all the same size, spaced
    8 bytes apart. Larger bins are approximately logarithmically
    spaced. (See the table below.) The `av_' array is never mentioned
    directly in the code, but instead via bin access macros.

    Bin layout:

    64 bins of size       8
    32 bins of size      64
    16 bins of size     512
     8 bins of size    4096
     4 bins of size   32768
     2 bins of size  262144
     1 bin  of size what's left

    There is actually a little bit of slop in the numbers in bin_index
    for the sake of speed. This makes no difference elsewhere.

    The special chunks `top' and `last_remainder' get their own bins,
    (this is implemented via yet more trickery with the av_ array),
    although `top' is never properly linked to its bin since it is
    always handled specially.

/* Main public routines */

/*
  Malloc Algorithm:

    The requested size is first converted into a usable form, `nb'.
    This currently means to add 4 bytes overhead plus possibly more to
    obtain 8-byte alignment and/or to obtain a size of at least
    MINSIZE (currently 16 bytes), the smallest allocatable size.
    (All fits are considered `exact' if they are within MINSIZE bytes.)

    From there, the first successful of the following steps is taken:

      1. The bin corresponding to the request size is scanned, and if
         a chunk of exactly the right size is found, it is taken.

      2. The most recently remaindered chunk is used if it is big
         enough.  This is a form of (roving) first fit, used only in
         the absence of exact fits. Runs of consecutive requests use
         the remainder of the chunk used for the previous such request
         whenever possible. This limited use of a first-fit style
         allocation strategy tends to give contiguous chunks
         coextensive lifetimes, which improves locality and can reduce
         fragmentation in the long run.

      3. Other bins are scanned in increasing size order, using a
         chunk big enough to fulfill the request, and splitting off
         any remainder.  This search is strictly by best-fit; i.e.,
         the smallest (with ties going to approximately the least
         recently used) chunk that fits is selected.

      4. If large enough, the chunk bordering the end of memory
         (`top') is split off. (This use of `top' is in accord with
         the best-fit search rule.  In effect, `top' is treated as
         larger (and thus less well fitting) than any other available
         chunk since it can be extended to be as large as necessary
         (up to system limitations).

      All allocations are made from the the `lowest' part of any found
      chunk. (The implementation invariant is that prev_inuse is
      always true of any allocated chunk; i.e., that each allocated
      chunk borders either a previously allocated and still in-use chunk,
      or the base of its memory arena.)

/*
  Realloc algorithm:

    If the reallocation is for additional space, and the
    chunk can be extended, it is, else a malloc-copy-free sequence is
    taken.  There are several different ways that a chunk could be
    extended. All are tried:

       * Extending forward into following adjacent free chunk.
       * Shifting backwards, joining preceding adjacent space
       * Both shifting backwards and extending forward.

    If the reallocation is for less space, and the new request is for
    a `small' (<512 bytes) size, then the newly unused space is lopped
    off and freed.

    The old unix realloc convention of allowing the last-free'd chunk
    to be used as an argument to realloc is no longer supported.
    I don't know of any programs still relying on this feature,
    and allowing it would also allow too many other incorrect 
    usages of realloc to be sensible.
