2003-03-25  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>
    
        Imported from trunk into 2.0 branch:
	* src/keytools.c (decode_keychange): Avoid undefined behaviour.
	(encode_keychange): Ditto.

2003-02-25  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>
       
        Imported from trunk into the 2.0 branch:
	* include/config.h: Make random use rand on FreeBSD.
	* include/system.h: For FreeBSD include param.h so we get the aliases.
	#Undefine printf so stdio.h will compile. printf is not used anywhere.

2003-02-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/snmplib.cdl: Add doc link.

2003-02-03  Manu Sharma <manu.sharma@ascom.com>

        * include/transform_oids.h,
        * src/keytools.c,
        * src/lcd_time.c,
        * src/scapi.c,
        * src/snmp_api.c,
        * src/snmp_client.c,
        * src/snmpusm.c,
        * src/snmpv3.c,
        * src/tools.c,
        * src/vacm.c : Support to conditionally implement SNMPv3 features, 
        based on definition of CYGPKG_SNMPAGENT_V3_SUPPORT.

2002-12-06  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

        * cdl/snmplib.cdl: Make use of the CYGINT_IO_FILEIO_FS interface
        to determine if there are any filesystems in the system.
        
2002-11-11  Manu Sharma <manu.sharma@ascom.com>

        * cdl/snmplib.cdl: Added new component
          CYGPKG_SNMPLIB_FILESYSTEM_SUPPORT to support usage of the
          snmpd.conf file based agent configuration.

        * src/read_config.c: Include functions that read the snmpd.conf
          file and setup the infrastructure based on configurations in
          this file.

2002-02-01  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/system.c: 
	* src/snmp_api.c: Need valid value for sin_len.

2002-01-18  Andrew Lunn  <Andrew.Lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/system.c (get_myaddr): The information returned by the ioctl
	call SIOCGIFCONF is not a simple array of fixed length
	entries. Look at each entry to work out its length.
	
2001-10-05  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/config.h: CYGINT_ISO_DNS changed to bool.

2001-09-24  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/config.h: Define HAVE_GETHOSTBYNAME only if a DNS
	package is available.

2001-05-28  Andrew Lunn  <Andrew.Lunn@ascom.ch>
2001-05-28  Manu Sharma  <Manu.Sharma@ascom.ch>

	* src/snmpusm.c, include/snmpusm.h: Added the ability to tell the
	agent the time of day has changed. This is used when an NTP client
	finds out the correct time and jumps time forward by 30 odd years.

	* include/config.h: If we have the OpenSSL package let the SNMP
	agent use it.
	
2001-01-10  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/snmplib.cdl: Clarify ISO C requirements

2000-11-07  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>
2000-11-07  Andrew Lunn <Andrew.Lunn@ascom.ch>

	* include/config.h (STRUCT_SOCKADDR_HAS_SA_LEN): #defined.
	The BSD stack uses sa_len in its sockaddr structures, so the agent
	must also use them or when it tries to send traps the stack
	rejects them because the destination addres is invalid.

2000-06-21  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/snmp_logging.c: 
	* src/parse.c: Catch unprotected includes of sys/stat.h,
	accidentally acquired from the stdinc/newlib world.  Now prevented
	by the might of #ifndef __ECOS.

2000-06-14  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/snmplib.cdl: Add option CYGDBG_NET_SNMPLIB_DEBUG to control
	the standard UCD debugging.

	* include/config.h: React to the above, and remove deal with
	default definitions from the agent configury for system MIB
	values.

2000-06-14  John Dallaway  <jld@redhat.com>

	* cdl/snmplib.cdl: Tidy display strings.

2000-06-14  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/snmplib.cdl: Install all the header files below
	include/ucd-snmp/ as is the normal host-side standard; this avoids
	some rather terrible filenamespace pollution too.  That location
	is also added to the include path, using a mechanism that's rather
	build-method-specific; it may need revisiting.

2000-06-14  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/snmplib.cdl: parent this below CYGPKG_NET.

2000-06-12  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/system.c (gettimeofday): Simulate this using libc's time()
	function which will call through to a wallclock of one is present,
	or just count up from start time.

2000-06-02  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/parse.c (add_mibdir): Return no mibs here, oh no; they're
	not needed for agent use of the library.  Waste of time - unless
	someone is liable to use the snmplib for tool rather than agent
	purposes.

	This goes along with the change to the agent to remove the ROFS
	which contained all the MIBs - I had thought that the library
	*needed* them to function, but it's not so - reading them in
	(and complaining of their absence) is part of the snmplib startup,
	but it's not needed by an agent.  This also means that if
	reinstated they should live here in the lib component rather than
	over there in the agent one; oh well.

2000-05-31  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* Initial commit of port of UCD-SNMP version 4.1.2 to eCos.
