<TITLE>SNMP packages in the <EMPHASIS>eCos</EMPHASIS> source repository</TITLE>
<PARA>
The SNMP/eCos package consists of two eCos packages;
the SNMP library and the SNMP agent.
</PARA>
<PARA>
The sources are arranged this way partly for consistency with
the original release from UCD, and so as to accommodate possible
future use of the SNMP library without having an agent present.
That could be used to build an eCos-based SNMP client application.
</PARA>
<PARA>
The library contains support code for talking SNMP over the
net - the SNMP protocol itself - and a MIB file parser (ASN-1) which
is not used in the agent case.
</PARA>
<PARA>
The agent contains the application specific handler files
to get information about the system into the SNMP world, together
with the SNMP agent thread
(<LITERAL>snmpd</LITERAL> in <LITERAL>UNIX</LITERAL> terms).

<PARA>
Small changes have been made in three areas:
</PARA>
<orderedlist>
<listitem><PARA>Various hardware-specific ethernet drivers.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The generic ethernet device driver.</PARA></listitem>
<listitem><para>The OpenBSD TCP/IP networking package.</PARA></listitem>
</orderedlist>
<PARA>
These changes were made in order to export information about the driver and
the network that the SNMP agent must report.  The changes were trivial in
the case of the network stack, since it was already SNMP-friendly.  The
generic ethernet device driver was re-organized to have an extensive header
file and to add a couple of APIs to extract statistics that the
hardware-specific device drivers keep within themselves.
</PARA>
<PARA>
There may be a performance hit for recording that data; disabling
a config option named something like
<LITERAL>CYGDBG_DEVS_ETH_xxxx_xxxx_KEEP_STATISTICS</LITERAL>
depending on the specific device driver will prevent that.
</PARA>
<PARA>
Not all platform ethernet device drivers export complete SNMP statistical
information; if the exported information is missing, SNMP will report zero
values for such data (in the dot3 MIB).
</PARA>
<PARA>
The interface chipset has an ID which is an OID; not all the latest greatest
devices are listed in the abailable database, so new chipsets may need to
be added to the client MIB, if not defined in those from UCD.
</PARA>
</SECT1>
<SECT1 id="net-snmp-starting-the-snmp-agent">
<TITLE>Starting the SNMP Agent</TITLE>
<PARA>
A routine to instantiate and start the SNMP agent thread in the default
configuration is provided in
<filename>PACKAGES/net/snmp/agent/VERSION/src/snmptask.c</filename>
</PARA>
<PARA>
It starts the snmpd thread at priority
<LITERAL>CYGPKG_NET_THREAD_PRIORITY+1</LITERAL>
by default, ie. one step less important than the TCP/IP stack service
thread.
It also statically creates and uses a very large stack of around 100
KiloBytes.
To use that convenience function, this code fragment may be copied (in
plain C).
</PARA>
<PROGRAMLISTING>
#ifdef CYGPKG_SNMPAGENT
{
                extern void cyg_net_snmp_init(void);
                cyg_net_snmp_init();

#endif
</PROGRAMLISTING>
<PARA>
In case you need to perform initialization, for example setting up SNMPv3
security features, when the snmp agent starts and every time it restarts,
you can register a callback function by simply writing the global variable:
<PROGRAMLISTING>
externC void (*<EMPHASIS>snmpd_reinit_function</EMPHASIS>)( void );
</PROGRAMLISTING>
with a suitable function pointer.
</PARA>
<PARA>
The entry point to the SNMP agent is
<PROGRAMLISTING>
externC void <FUNCTION>snmpd</FUNCTION>( void (*<EMPHASIS>initfunc</EMPHASIS>)( void ) );
</PROGRAMLISTING>
so you can of course easily start it in a thread of your choice at another
priority instead if required, after performing whatever other
initialization your SNMP MIBs need.  A larger than default stacksize is
required.  The <LITERAL>initfunc</LITERAL> parameter is the callback
function mentioned above &mdash; a NULL parameter there is safe and
obviously means no callback is registered.
</PARA>
<PARA>
Note that if you call <LITERAL>snmpd();</LITERAL> yourself and do
<EMPHASIS>not</EMPHASIS> call <LITERAL>cyg_net_snmp_init();</LITERAL> then
that routine, global variable, and the default large stack will not be
used.  This is the recommended way control such features from your
application; create and start the thread yourself at the appropriate
moment.
</PARA>
<PARA>
Other APIs from the <LITERAL>snmpd</LITERAL> module are available,
specifically:
<PROGRAMLISTING>
void <FUNCTION>SnmpdShutDown</FUNCTION>(int <EMPHASIS>a</EMPHASIS>);
</PROGRAMLISTING>
which causes the <LITERAL>snmpd</LITERAL> to restart itself &mdash;
including the callback to your init function &mdash; as soon as possible.
</PARA>
<PARA>
The parameter <EMPHASIS>a</EMPHASIS> is ignored.  It is there because in
<LITERAL>snmpd</LITERAL>'s &ldquo;natural environment&rdquo; this routine
is a <LITERAL>UNIX</LITERAL> signal handler.
</PARA>
<PARA>
The helper functions in the network stack for managing
<LITERAL>DHCP</LITERAL>
leases will call <FUNCTION>SnmpdShutDown()</FUNCTION>
when necessary, for example if network interfaces go down and/or come up
again.
</PARA>
</SECT1>
<SECT1 id="net-snmp-configuring-ecos">
<TITLE>Configuring eCos</TITLE>
<PARA>
To use the SNMP agent, the SNMP library and agent packages must be
included in your configuration. To incorporate the stack into your
configuration select the SNMP library and SNMP agent packages in the
eCos Configuration Tool, or at the command line type:
<SCREEN>
$ <USERINPUT>ecosconfig add snmplib snmpagent</USERINPUT>
</SCREEN>
</PARA>
<PARA>
After adding the networking, common ethernet device drivers,
snmp library and snmp agent packages, there is no configuration
required. However there are a number of configuration options
that can be set such as some details for the System MIB, and
disabling SNMPv3 support (see below).
</PARA>
<PARA>
Starting the SNMP agent is not integrated into network
tests other than <FILENAME>snmpping</FILENAME> below, nor is it
started automatically in normal eCos startup -
it is up to the application to start the agent when it is ready,
at least after the network interfaces are both &lsquo;up&rsquo;.
</PARA>
<SECT2 id="net-snmp-version-usage">
<TITLE>Version usage (v1, v2 or v3)</TITLE>
<PARA>
The default build supports all three versions of the SNMP protocol, but without
any dispatcher functionality (rfc 2571, section 3.1.1.2). This has the
following implications :
</PARA>
<PARA> 1. There is no community authentication for v1 and v2c.</PARA>
<PARA>2. Security provided by v3 can be bypassed by using v1/v2c protocol.</PARA>
<PARA>
To provide the dispatcher with rfc 2571 type functionality, it is required to
set up security models and access profiles. This can be provided in the normal
Unix style by writing the required configurations in <LITERAL>snmpd.conf</LITERAL> 
file. Application code may setup profiles in <LITERAL>snmpd.conf</LITERAL> and 
optionally set the environment variable <LITERAL>SNMPCONFPATH</LITERAL> to 
point to the file if it is not in the usual location. The whole concept works
in the usual way as with the standard UCD-SNMP distribution.
</PARA>

<SECT2 id="Traps">
<TITLE>Traps</TITLE>
<PARA>
The support of the <LITERAL>trapsink</LITERAL> command in the
<link linkend="net-snmp-agent-manpages-snmpd.conf">snmpd.conf</link> file is not tested 
and there may be problems for it working as expected. Moreover, in systems that do not 
have filesystem support, there is no way to configure a trap-session in the
conventional way.
</PARA>
<PARA>
For reasons mentioned above, applications need to initialize their own trap
sessions and pass it the details of trap-sink. The following is a small sample
for initializing a v1 trap session :
</PARA>
<PROGRAMLISTING>
typedef struct trap {

}
</PROGRAMLISTING>
</SECT2>
<SECT2 id="net-snmp-snmpd-conf">
<TITLE><LITERAL>snmpd.conf</LITERAL> file</TITLE>
<PARA>
Using snmpd.conf requires the inclusion of one of the file-system packages
(eg. CYGPKG_RAMFS) and CYGPKG_FILEIO. With these two packages included, the
SNMP sub-system will read the snmpd.conf file from the location specified in
<LITERAL>SNMPCONFPATH</LITERAL>, or the standard builtin locations, and use
these profiles. Only the profiles specified in the <LITERAL>ACCESS-CONTROL</LITERAL>
section of <link linkend="net-snmp-agent-manpages-snmpd.conf">snmpd.conf</link> file have 
been tested and shown to work. Other profiles which have been implemented in 
<LITERAL>UCD-SNMP-4.1.2</LITERAL>'s <LITERAL>snmpd.conf</LITERAL> may not work
because the sole purpose of adding support for the snmpd.conf file has been to
set up <LITERAL>ACCESS-CONTROL</LITERAL> models.
</PARA>
<PARA>
At startup, the SNMP module tries to look for file <FILENAME>snmp.conf</FILENAME>. 
If this file is not available, the module successively looks for files
<FILENAME>snmpd.conf</FILENAME>, <FILENAME>snmp.local.conf</FILENAME> and 
<FILENAME>snmpd.local.conf</FILENAME> at the locations pointed to by <LITERAL>
SNMPCONFPATH</LITERAL> environment variable. In case <LITERAL>SNMPCONFPATH
</LITERAL> is not defined, the search sequence is carried out in default directories.
The default directories are :<FILENAME>/usr/share/snmp</filename>, <filename>
/usr/local/share/snmp</filename> and <filename>$(HOME)/.snmp</filename>.
The configurations read from these files are used to control both, SNMP 
applications and the SNMP agent; in the usual UNIX fashion.
</PARA>
<PARA>
The inclusion of snmpd.conf support is enabled by default when suitable 
filesystems and FILEIO packages are active.
</PARA>
</SECT2>
</SECT1>
<SECT1 id="net-snmp-test-cases">
<TITLE>Test cases</TITLE>
<PARA>
Currently only one test program is provided which uses SNMP.
</PARA>
<PARA>
"snmpping" in the SNMP agent package runs the ping test from
the TCPIP package, with the snmpd running also. This allows you
to interrogate it using host tools of your choice. It supports MIBs
as documented above, so eg. <COMMAND>snmpwalk
<REPLACEABLE>&lt;hostname&gt;</REPLACEABLE> public dot3</COMMAND> under
Linux/UNIX should have the desired effect.
</PARA>
<PARA>
For serious testing, you should increase the length of time
the test runs by setting CYGNUM_SNMPAGENT_TESTS_ITERATIONS
to something big (e.g., 999999). Build the test
(<COMMAND>make -C net/snmp/agent/current tests</COMMAND>)
and run it on the target.
</PARA>
<PARA>
Then start several jobs, some for pinging the board (to make
the stats change) and some for interrogating the snmpd. Set &dollar;IP
to whatever IP address the board has:
</PARA>
<PROGRAMLISTING>
# in a root shell, for flood ping
while(1)
date
ping -f -c 3001 &dollar;IP
sleep 5
ping -c 32 -s 2345 &dollar;IP

# have more than one of these going at once
setenv MIBS all
while (1)
snmpwalk -OS &dollar;IP  public
date
end</PROGRAMLISTING>
<PARA>
Leave to run for a couple of days or so to test stability.
</PARA>
<PARA>
The test program can also test snmpd.conf support. It tries to build a minimal
snmpd.conf file on a RAM filesystem and passes it to the snmp sub-system. With
this profile on target, the following snmp[cmd] (cmd=walk, get, set) should
work :
</PARA>
<PROGRAMLISTING>
snmp[cmd] -v1 $IP crux $OID
snmp[cmd] -v2 $IP crux $OID
snmp[cmd] -v3 $IP -u root -L noAuthNoPriv $OID
snmp[cmd] -v3 $IP -u root -L authNoPriv -A MD5 -a md5passwd $OID

The following commands would however fail since they violate the access model :
</PARA>

snmp[cmd] $IP public $OID
snmp[cmd] -v1 $IP public $OID
snmp[cmd] -v2c $IP public $OID

</SECT1>
<SECT1 id="net-snmp-clients-and-package-use">
<TITLE>SNMP clients and package use</TITLE>
<PARA>
SNMP clients may use these packages, but this usage is currently
untested: the reason why this port to eCos exists is to acquire
the SNMP agent.  The fact that that the SNMP API (for clients) exists
is a side-effect.  See the standard man page SNMP_API(3)
for details.  There are further caveats below about client-side
use of the SNMP library.
</PARA>
<PARA>
All of the SNMP header files are installed beneath .../include/ucd-snmp
in the install tree.  The SNMP code itself assumes that directory
is on its include path, so we recommend that client code does the
same.  Further, like the TCP/IP stack, compiling SNMP code
requires definition of _KERNEL and __ECOS,
and additionally IN_UCD_SNMP_SOURCE.
</PARA>
<PARA>
Therefore, add all of these to your compile lines if you wish

<PARA>
Currently, the filesystem and persistent storage areas are
left undone, to be implemented by the application.
</PARA>
<PARA>
The SNMP library package is intended to support client and
agent code alike.  It therefore contains lots of assumptions about
the presence of persistent storage ie. a filesystem.  Currently,
by default, eCos has no such thing, so those areas have been simply
commented out and made to return empty lists or say &ldquo;no
data here.&rdquo;

</PARA>
<PARA>
<filename>PACKAGES/net/snmp/lib/VERSION/src/parse.c</filename>

<PARA>
contains code to enumerate MIB files discovered in the system
MIB directories (&ldquo;<filename>/usr/share/snmp/mibs</filename>&rdquo;),
and read them all in, building data structures that are used by
client programs to interrogate an agent.  This is not required in
an agent, so the routine which enumerates the directories returns
an empty list.
</PARA>
<PARA>
<filename>PACKAGES/net/snmp/lib/VERSION/src/read_config.c</filename>
contains two systems:
</PARA>
<PARA>
The first tries to read the configuration file as described in the

the second system contains code to record persistent data as files in a
directory (typically <filename>/var/ucd-snmp</filename>) thus preserving the 
state permanently.
</PARA>
<PARA>
The first part is partially implemented to support multiple profiles and enables
dispatcher functionality as discussed in <xref linkend="net-snmp-version-usage">.
The second part is not supported at all in the default implementation. As required, 
a cleaner interface to permit application code to manage persistent data will be 
developed in consultation with customers.

It is likely that the output of mib2c will be further customized
depending on eCos customer needs; it&rsquo;s easy to do this
by editing the mib2c.conf file to add or remove whatever you need
with the resulting C sources.

<PARA>
The UCD autoconf-style configuration does not apply to eCos.
 So if you add a completely new MIB to the agent, and support it
using mib2c so that the my_new_mib.c file contains
a init_my_new_mib() routine to register
the MIB handler, you will also need to edit a couple of control
files; these claim to be auto-generated, but in the eCos release,
they&rsquo;re not, don&rsquo;t worry.
</PARA>
<PROGRAMLISTING>PACKAGES/net/snmp/agent/VERSION/include/mib_module_includes.h</PROGRAMLISTING>
<PARA>
contains a number of lines like
</PARA>
<PROGRAMLISTING>#include &ldquo;mibgroup/mibII/interfaces.h&rdquo;</PROGRAMLISTING>
<PARA>
so add your new MIB thus:
</PARA>
<PROGRAMLISTING>#include &ldquo;mibgroup/mibII/my_new_mib.h&rdquo;</PROGRAMLISTING>
<PROGRAMLISTING>PACKAGES/net/snmp/agent/VERSION/include/mib_module_inits.h </PROGRAMLISTING>
<PARA>
contains a number of lines like
</PARA>
<PROGRAMLISTING>init_interfaces();         
init_dot3(); </PROGRAMLISTING>
<PARA>
and so on; add your new MIB as follows:
</PARA>
<PROGRAMLISTING>init_my_new_mib(); </PROGRAMLISTING>
<PARA>
and this should work correctly.
