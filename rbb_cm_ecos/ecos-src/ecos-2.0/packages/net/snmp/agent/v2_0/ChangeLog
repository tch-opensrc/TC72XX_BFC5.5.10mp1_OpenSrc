	work with the FreeBSD stack yet.

	* doc/snmp.sgml: Document configuring packages better, and only use
	of OpenBSD stack.

2003-02-05  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* doc/snmp.sgml: Fix a doc build failure, and tweak some duff links and
	a few typos.

2003-02-03  Andrew Lunn <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

        features, based on definition of CYGPKG_SNMPAGENT_V3_SUPPORT.

2002-11-11  Manu Sharma <manu.sharma@ascom.com>

        * src/mibgroup/mibII/vacm_vars.c:
        * include/vacm_vars.h: Imported from the UCD-SNMP-4.1.2.  These
          are required to support VACM features, based on a snmpd.conf file.

        * cdl/snmpagent.cdl : Compile vacm_vars.c

        * include/mib_module_inits.h : Initialization of vacm and usm related 
          functions. The usm related functionality are no longer required to
          be initialized by application code.

        * tests/snmpping.c : Code to create a basic snmpd.conf file and
          enable its usage. This conditional on
          CYGPKG_SNMPLIB_FILESYSTEM_SUPPORT and require the ramfs package

        * doc/snmp.sgml: Documentation for above changes.

2002-08-14  David Smith  <dsmith@redhat.com>

	* src/agent_trap.c (send_enterprise_trap_vars):
	* src/snmp_agent.c (handle_var_list): Memory leak fixes from
	ucd-snmp-4.2.2.

2002-06-03  Gary Thomas  <gary@chez-thomas.org> (on behalf of)
2002-06-03  Roland Caﬂebohm <roland.cassebohm@visionsystems.de>

	* src/agent_trap.c (send_enterprise_trap_vars): 
	* src/snmp_agent.c (handle_snmp_packet): Fix memory leaks.

2002-03-19  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* doc/snmp.sgml: Fix the URLs for "where is SNMP now".

2002-02-14  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* doc/snmp.sgml: NEW FILE: Clarified and brought up to date
	somewhat.  Still rather vague - but then it's a port of UCD's
	work, we should not second-guess their expertise in the matter.

	Release notes section from when SNMP was distributed as a separate
	.EPK file removed - it was full of version- and platform-specific
	references, and rehashes of general repository management advice.

2002-02-05  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/snmptask.c: Pass a function pointer into dhcpd() for for
	SNMP reinitialization when its state cycles up-down-up; for
	example setting up v3 security, extra MIBs and the like.

	* src/snmpd.c (dhcpd): Handle re-init pointer.  Namespace tidied
	up a little too; state flags can be static no problem.

	* tests/snmpping.c (snmp_do_reinit): New function to test hook for
	SNMP reinitialization.  Also commit some stuff I've had around for
	ages to make this test very robust against eg. DHCP going away.
	It re-does the init_all_network_interfaces() and so on if any
	interface "up"ness changes, thus testing all that stuff too.
	Also looks at the correct symbol for SNMPv3 testing now.

2002-02-01  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* tests/snmpping.c (ping_test): 
	* src/agent_trap.c (send_enterprise_trap_vars): 
	Need valid value for sin_len.

2001-11-21  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/snmpd.c (snmpd): Explicit execution-time initialization of
	"running" variable, so that we can restart snmpd without it
	immediately exiting again.

	* src/snmptask.c (snmpdloop): Make the snmpd thread loop forever,
	so that we can restart it when the state of all the interfaces
	changes.

2001-08-14  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* tests/snmpping.c: 
	* cdl/snmpagent.cdl: Add CDL options to configure tests.

2001-07-31  Hugo Tyson <hmt@redhat.com>
2001-07-31  Ron Kundla <rkundla@nband.com>

	* utils/mib2c/mib2c (Table-handling): Concatenate rather than
	replace subsequent processed variables.  The symptom was that in
	the generated header file you only get the last table in the MIB.
	This fixes it.  Thanks Ron!

2001-06-07  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/mibgroup/mibII/ip.c (var_ipNetToMediaTable): Only handle
	IPNETTOMEDIAPHYSADDRESS for devices with associated hardware.

2001-05-29  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* tests/snmpping.c (net_test): Committed the improved version of
	this that I've been using for a while - with new improved SNMPv3
	testing.  This requires (in the current setup) explicit init of
	the SNMPv3 MIBs and a "user" for authentication purposes.  The
	test can also be set to run the interfaces in promiscuous mode,
	and/or to run forever, and it has lots better diagnostics if you
	see mangled ping packets.  And the ping size varies too, to test
	ICMP defragmentation.

2001-05-29  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>
2001-05-28  Manu Sharma <Manu.Sharam@ascom.ch>
2001-05-28  Andrew Lunn <Andrew.Lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/mibgroup/mibII/interfaces.c (var_ifTable): Support a direct
	call into a customer's device ioctl() for devices of type
	IFT_CUSTOMER_SPECIAL - if they have defined it.  This is to make
	it easier to add a custom interface type and have SNMP deal with
	it properly without editting the SNMP sources.

	* include/snmpEngine.h, include/usmState.h, include/usmUser.h:
	* src/mibgroup/snmpv3/snmpEngine.c, src/mibgroup/snmpv3/usmStats.c:
	* src/mibgroup/snmpv3/usmUser.c: NEW FILES: Added support of
	SNMPv3 User based Security Module (USM). This adds
	authentification and encryption to snmp requests and replies.

	* cdl/snmpagent.cdl: Build the new files above.

2001-05-08  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* utils/mib2c/README-eCos: Clarify usage of mib2c a bit.

2001-01-17  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/mibgroup/util_funcs.c (restart_hook): Don't use alarm() in eCos
	(wait_on_exec): Don't use waitpid() in eCos
	The above prevent link errors.

2001-01-10  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/snmpagent.cdl: Clarify ISO C requirements

2000-11-29  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>
2000-11-29  Andrew Lunn <Andrew.Lunn@ascom.ch>
	* src/mibgroup/mibII/dot3.c (var_dot3StatsTable): 
	* src/mibgroup/mibII/interfaces.c (var_ifTable): 
	Undo Hugo's fix; it fails if there are holes in the if_index space
	(not something I expected).  Use this fix instead, from Andrew.
	[CASE 104939]
	
	* src/mibgroups/mibII/ip.c: IPADENTIFINDEX should return the
	interface index as seen in the interface group.  This is not the
	if_index but merely acquired by counting.

2000-11-17  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/mibgroup/mibII/dot3.c (var_dot3StatsTable): 
	* src/mibgroup/mibII/interfaces.c (var_ifTable): Use the
	last component of the OID to select the matching interface rather
	than merely counting through them.  Thus this MIB matches eg. the
	IP MIB in terms of ip.ipAddrTable.ipAddrEntry.ipAdEntIfIndex.
	[CASE 104939 "snmp interface and IP group don't correspond"]

2000-08-31  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/snmpping.c (net_test): Add use of network realtime test
	harness - if available.  One example is provided for the EBSA285
	in "devs/eth/arm/ebsa285/VERSION/tests/test_net_realtime.h"

2000-08-25  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/mibgroup/mibII/dot3.c (var_dot3StatsTable): A little further
	diddling; have a bool to say whether the dot3 info is filled in.

2000-08-24  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/mibgroup/mibII/dot3.c (var_dot3StatsTable):
	* src/mibgroup/mibII/interfaces.c (var_ifTable): Use new ioctl()
	interface to get information out of ethernet devices.  If the
	ioctl call is not supported, we just get default values.

2000-08-16  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/snmpd.c (snmpd): Remove call to
	init_all_network_interfaces(); it's a bad idea for the situations
	when initialization has been done externally to our helper
	functions.  This adds the constraint that you must initialize the
	network interfaces first, by whatever means.  Starting snmpd
	before the network is up may cause confusion.
	[CASE 104330]

	Also tidied some warnings.

2000-07-25  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/snmpping.c (net_test): Make it ping the loopback
	interfaces so as to do some valid testing in the absence of any
	real interfaces on the platform.  Also make it run less time or no
	doubt the farm will report many non-failures.

2000-07-13  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/snmpping.c: Up the stack size to cope with full DHCP
	initialization in init_all_network_interfaces().

2000-06-27  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/mibgroup/mibII/dot3.c (var_dot3StatsTable): Forgot the
	DOT3STATSINDEX for loopback, so it claimed index 0.  Fixed.

2000-06-26  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/snmptask.c (cyg_net_snmp_init): Change the priority of the
	SNMP thread; make it one less important than the network thread of
	which it is a client.

2000-06-19  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/mibgroup/mibII/dot3.c (var_dot3StatsTable): Don't trip over
	loopback interface; it doesn't support the same enquiries as an
	eth device.

	* src/mibgroup/mibII/interfaces.c (var_ifTable): Don't trip over
	loopback interface; it doesn't support the same enquiries as an
	eth device.

2000-06-14  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/snmpagent.cdl: Add options for the default values for system
	MIB vals that describe the machine.

	* src/mibgroup/mibII/system_mib.c (init_system_mib): Pick up
	values from configury (this goes via config.h in the library).

2000-06-14  John Dallaway  <jld@redhat.com>

	* cdl/snmpagent.cdl: Tidy display strings.

2000-06-14  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/snmpagent.cdl: Install all the header files below
	include/ucd-snmp/ as is the normal host-side standard; this avoids
	some rather terrible filenamespace pollution too.  That location
	is also added to the include path, using a mechanism that's rather
	build-method-specific; it may need revisiting.

2000-06-14  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/snmpagent.cdl: parent this below CYGPKG_NET.

2000-06-13  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/snmpagent.cdl: Add mibgroup/mibII/dot3.c to compile list.

	* src/mibgroup/mibII/dot3.c (var_dot3StatsTable): Done that - and
	it required changes to the EBSA ether device driver.  Of course,
	if those info-macros are not present, the SNMP agent module uses
	zeros, so it should "work" half-heartedly with other platforms
	too.

	* include/mibgroup/mibII/dot3.h: Completed handler function list.

	* src/mibgroup/mibII/interfaces.c (var_ifTable): This now makes
	use of info-macros exported from the ethernet dd.

	* include/mib_module_inits.h: Call init_dot3() in the bootup.

	* src/mibgroup/mibII/system_mib.c (init_system_mib): Fill in
	default system type description.

2000-06-09  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/mibgroup/mibII/tcp.c (var_tcpConnTable): Done that.

2000-06-09  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/mibgroup/mibII/udp.c (var_udpTable): Done that.

2000-06-08  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/mibgroup/mibII/icmp.c (var_icmp): Fleshed this out with a
	copy from the UCD version - BSD stack nosing-in-kernel memory arm
	of the code is the same, unsurprisingly.

2000-06-08  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/mibgroup/mibII/ip.c (var_ip): Flesh this out; it's mostly
	there now.

	* src/mibgroup/mibII/interfaces.c (var_ifTable): Make this more
	consistent, particularly the use of FIXMEs for the bits I have not
	completed yet.

2000-06-06  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/mibgroup/mibII/interfaces.c (var_ifTable): Flesh this out
	with lots of snooping into the ifnet structures and a little info
	from the device driver.  The info is there now.

	* src/mibgroup/mibII/tcp.c (var_tcpConnTable,var_ipv6TcpConnTable):
	* src/mibgroup/mibII/udp.c (var_udpTable,var_ipv6UdpTable):
	* src/mibgroup/mibII/ip.c (var_ipAddrTable,var_ipNetToMediaTable):
	Fix these (by commenting out) parts for complex tables that made
	the snmpwalk tool crash out; ie. it acts as if all such complex
	tables are empty, rather than returning badly indexed entries.

2000-06-02  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* utils/mib2c/README-eCos:
	* utils/mib2c/README.mib2c:
	* utils/mib2c/mib2c:
	* utils/mib2c/mib2c.conf:
	* utils/mib2c/mib2c.conf-ORIG:
	* utils/mib2c/mib2c.storage.conf:
	* utils/mib2c/mib2c.vartypes.conf:
	New files, just to keep my variant of mib2c.conf under source
	controlled; it includes our copyright (and attribution to UCD et
	al, of course) the different include paths as required by eCos'
	package layout and a couple of other nits sorted out.

2000-06-02  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/snmpagent.cdl (compile): Omit the read-only file-system
	part; the library will cheerfully use it, but it's not at all
	necessary.  Waste of time - unless someone is liable to use the
	snmplib for tool rather than agent purposes.

	* include/mib_module_includes.h: Include the full set of includes
	for the MIBs we will implement.  Ie.
	  mibgroup/mibII/system_mib.h  // { mib2 1 }
	  mibgroup/mibII/sysORTable.h  // { mib2 1.9.1 } == { system 9.1 }
	  mibgroup/mibII/interfaces.h  // { mib2 2 }
	  (NOT mibgroup/mibII/at.h)    // #3 is deprecated
	  mibgroup/mibII/ip.h          // { mib2 4 }
	  mibgroup/mibII/icmp.h        // { mib2 5 }
	  mibgroup/mibII/tcp.h         // { mib2 6 }
	  mibgroup/mibII/udp.h         // { mib2 7 }
	  mibgroup/mibII/dot3.h        // { mib2 10.7 } == { transmission 7 }
	  mibgroup/mibII/snmp_mib.h    // { mib2 11 }

	* include/mib_module_inits.h: Same thing really; but dot3 is not
	yet in there at all, it'll be added later.
	  init_system_mib();  // { mib2 1 }
	  init_sysORTable();  // { mib2 1.9.1 } == { system 9.1 }
	  init_interfaces();  // { mib2 2 }
	  //init_at();        // #3 is deprecated
	  init_ip();          // { mib2 4 }
	  init_icmp();        // { mib2 5 }
	  init_tcp();         // { mib2 6 }
	  init_udp();         // { mib2 7 }
	  //init_dot3();      // { mib2 10.7 } == { transmission 7 } FIXME
	  init_snmp_mib();    // { mib2 11 }

	* include/mibgroup/mibII/icmp.h:
	* include/mibgroup/mibII/interfaces.h:
	* include/mibgroup/mibII/ip.h:
	* include/mibgroup/mibII/tcp.h:
	* include/mibgroup/mibII/udp.h:
	These files have all been replaced by versions direct from mib2c,
	without any of the UNIX/LINUX/Win32-specific gubbins from the
	original versions.

	* include/mibgroup/mibII/dot3.h: New file direct from mib2c.

	* include/mibgroup/mibII/route_write.h: DELETED
	* include/mibgroup/mibII/at.h: DELETED
	* include/mibgroup/mibII/var_route.h: DELETED
	Removed, not necessary for the vanilla headers; they were there
	before to satisfy include needs of the originals.

	* src/mibgroup/mibII/dot3.c:
	* src/mibgroup/mibII/icmp.c:
	* src/mibgroup/mibII/interfaces.c:
	* src/mibgroup/mibII/ip.c:
	* src/mibgroup/mibII/tcp.c:
	* src/mibgroup/mibII/udp.c:
	These are new files, direct from mib2c, again without all the
	UNIX/LINUX/Win32-specific gubbins from the original versions.

	* src/rofs/EtherLike-MIB.c: DELETED
	* src/rofs/IANAifType-MIB.c: DELETED
	* src/rofs/IF-MIB.c: DELETED
	* src/rofs/IP-MIB.c: DELETED
	* src/rofs/RFC-1215.c: DELETED
	* src/rofs/SNMPv2-CONF.c: DELETED
	* src/rofs/SNMPv2-MIB.c: DELETED
	* src/rofs/SNMPv2-SMI.c: DELETED
	* src/rofs/SNMPv2-TC.c: DELETED
	* src/rofs/SNMPv2-TM.c: DELETED
	* src/rofs/TCP-MIB.c: DELETED
	* src/rofs/UDP-MIB.c: DELETED
	* src/rofs/snmprofs.c: DELETED
	Turns out that I don't need a read-only FS with all the MIBs in in
	the agent - reading them in (and complaining of their absence) is
	part of the snmplib startup, but it's not needed by an agent.
	This also means that if reinstated they should live in the lib
	component rather than the agent one; oh well.
