<h1>
TCP/IP Networking for eCos</h1></center>
eCos now provides a complete TCP/IP networking stack.&nbsp; This package
was derived from the latest stable release of <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
At this time, the networking support is considered "beta" quality although
it is already fully featured and well tested within the eCos environment.
<p>Ethernet drivers are provided for these standard supported platforms:
<blockquote>
<li>
Motorola PowerPC MBX/860</li>

<li>
Cirrus Logic EDB72xx</li>
</blockquote>
Other drivers for supported platforms are planned or underway.
<h4>
Networking Stack Features</h4>
Since this networking package is based on the venerable BSD code, it is
very complete and robust.&nbsp; The eCos implementation includes support
for these protocols:
<blockquote>
<li>
IPv4</li>

<li>
UDP</li>

<li>
TCP</li>

<li>
ICMP</li>

<li>
raw packet interface</li>
</blockquote>
These additional features are also present in the package.&nbsp; However
they are not yet supported:
<blockquote>
<li>
Berkeley Packet Filter</li>

<li>
Multi-cast and uni-cast support, including multi-casting routing</li>

<li>
IPv6</li>
</blockquote>

<h4>
Provided Documentation</h4>
Since the networking package is "beta", documentation is still a bit thin.&nbsp;
However, you will find a complete set of pages documenting the supported
networking functions (user code API) <a href="tcpip_library.html">here</a>.
<h4>
Ethernet Driver Design</h4>
Note: Currently, the networking stack only supports ethernet based networking.
<p>The network drivers use a two-layer design.&nbsp; One layer is hardware
independent but contains all the stack specific code.&nbsp; The other layer
is platform dependent and communicates with the hardware independent layer
via a very simple API.&nbsp; In this way, hardware device drivers can actually
be used with other stacks, if the same API can be provided by that stack.&nbsp;
We designed the drivers this way to encourage the development of other
stacks in eCos while allowing reuse of the actual hardware specific code.
<p>Complete documentation of the ethernet device driver and the associated
API can be found in the file <tt>net/drivers/eth/common/<i>version</i>/doc/driver_doc</tt>.
<h4>
Sample Code</h4>
Many examples using the networking support are provided.&nbsp; These are
arranged as eCos test programs, primarily for us to verify the package,
but also can serve as useful frameworks for program design.&nbsp; We have
taken a <i>KISS </i>approach to building programs which use the network.&nbsp;
A single include file <tt>&lt;network.h></tt> is all that is required to
access the stack.&nbsp; A complete, annotated test program can be found
<a href="sample_program.html">here</a>.
