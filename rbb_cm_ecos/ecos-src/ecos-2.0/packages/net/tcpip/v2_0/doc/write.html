NAME
       write - write to a file descriptor

SYNOPSIS
       ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);

DESCRIPTION
       write  writes  up to count bytes to the file referenced by
       the file descriptor fd from the buffer  starting  at  buf.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, the number of bytes written are returned (zero
       indicates nothing was written).  On error, -1 is returned,
       and  errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EBADF  fd is not a valid file descriptor or  is  not  open
              for writing.

       EINVAL fd is attached to an object which is unsuitable for
              writing.

       EPIPE  fd is connected to a socket  whose  reading
              end  is closed.

       EAGAIN Non-blocking I/O has been selected using O_NONBLOCK
              and  there  was  no room in the pipe or socket con­
              nected to fd to write the data immediately.

       EINTR  The call was interrupted before  any
              data was written.

       ENOSPC The  device  containing  the file referred to by fd
              has no room for the data.

       EIO    A low-level I/O error occurred.
