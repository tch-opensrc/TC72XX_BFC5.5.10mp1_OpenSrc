NAME
       recvfrom - receive a message from a socket

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;network.h&gt;

       int recvfrom(int s, void *buf, int len, unsigned int flags
       struct sockaddr *from, int *fromlen);

DESCRIPTION
       The  recvfrom call is used to receive messages from a socket, 
       and may be used to receive data on a socket whether or not it 
       is connection-oriented.


       If from is not NULL, and the socket is not connection-ori­
       ented, the source address of the  message  is  filled  in.
       Fromlen  is  a  value-result parameter, initialized to the
       size of the buffer associated with from, and  modified  on
       return  to  indicate the actual size of the address stored
       there.

       The routine  returns  the length of the message on
       successful completion.  If a message is too long to fit in
       the supplied buffer, excess bytes may be discarded depend­
       ing on the type of socket the  message  is  received  from
       (see socket(2)).

       If  no  messages  are available at the socket, the receive
       calls wait for a message to arrive, unless the  socket  is
       nonblocking  (see  fcntl(2)) in which case the value -1 is
       returned and the external variable errno  set  to  EAGAIN.
       The  receive  calls normally return any data available, up
       to the requested amount, rather than waiting  for  receipt
       of the full amount requested.

       The  select(2)  call may be used to determine
       when more data arrives.

       The flags argument to a recvfrom call is formed by OR'ing  one
       or more of the following values:

       MSG_OOB
              This flag requests receipt of out-of-band data that
              would not be received in the  normal  data  stream.
              Some  protocols place expedited data at the head of
              the normal data queue, and thus this flag cannot be
              used with such protocols.

       MSG_PEEK
              This  flag  causes  the receive operation to return
              data from the beginning of the receive queue  with­
              out  removing  that  data  from the queue.  Thus, a
              subsequent receive call will return the same  data.

       MSG_WAITALL
              This  flag  requests that the operation block until
              the full request is satisfied.  However,  the  call
              may still return less data than requested if a sig­
              nal is caught, an error or  disconnect  occurs,  or
              the next data to be received is of a different type
              than that returned.

       MSG_ERRQUEUE
              Receive packet from the error queue

       MSG_NOSIGNAL
              This flag turns off raising of  SIGPIPE  on  stream
              sockets when the other end disappears.

       MSG_ERRQUEUE
              This  flag  specifies  that queued errors should be
              received from the socket error queue.  The error is
              passed  in  a ancilliary message with a type depen­
              dent on the  protocol  (for  IP  IP_RECVERR).   The
              error  is  supplied in a sock_extended_error struc­
              ture:

              #define SO_EE_ORIGIN_NONE       0
              #define SO_EE_ORIGIN_LOCAL      1
              #define SO_EE_ORIGIN_ICMP       2
              #define SO_EE_ORIGIN_ICMP6      3

              struct sock_extended_err
              {
                  __u32           ee_errno;   /* error number */
                  __u8            ee_origin;  /* where the error originated */
                  __u8            ee_type;    /* type */
                  __u8            ee_code;    /* code */
                  __u8            ee_pad;
                  __u32           ee_info;    /* additional information */
                  __u32           ee_data;    /* other data */
              };

              struct sockaddr *SOCK_EE_OFFENDER(struct sock_extended_err *);

              ee_errno contains the errno number  of  the  queued
              error.   ee_origin  is the origin code of where the
              error originated.  The other  fields  are  protocol
              specific.   SOCK_EE_OFFENDER  returns  a pointer to
              the address of the network object where  the  error
              originated  from. If this address is not known, the
              sa_family member of the sockaddr contains AF_UNSPEC
              and the other fields of the sockaddr are undefined.
              The payload of the packet that caused the error  is
              passed as normal data.

              For local errors, no address is passed (this can be
              checked with the cmsg_len member of  the  cmsghdr).
              For  error receives, the MSG_ERRQUEUE is set in the
              msghdr.  After a error has been passed, the pending
              socket  error  is  regenerated  based  on  the next
              queued error and will be passed on the next  socket
              operation.


       The msg_flags field is set on return according to the mes­
       sage  received.  MSG_EOR indicates end-of-record; the data
       returned completed a record (generally used  with  sockets
       of  type  SOCK_SEQPACKET).   MSG_TRUNC  indicates that the
       trailing portion of a datagram was discarded  because  the
       datagram  was larger than the buffer supplied.  MSG_CTRUNC
       indicates that some control data  were  discarded  due  to
       lack  of  space in the buffer for ancillary data.  MSG_OOB
       is returned to indicate that expedited or out-of-band data
       were  received.   MSG_ERRQUEUE  indicates that no data was
       received but an  extended  error  from  the  socket  error
       queue.

RETURN VALUES
       These  calls return the number of bytes received, or -1 if
       an error occurred.

ERRORS
       These are some standard errors  generated  by  the  socket
       layer.  Additional  errors  may  be generated and returned
       from the underlying protocol  modules;  see  their  manual
       pages.

       EBADF   The argument s is an invalid descriptor.

       ENOTSOCK
               The argument s does not refer to a socket.

       EAGAIN  The  socket is marked non-blocking and the receive
               operation would block, or a  receive  timeout  had
               been  set  and the timeout expired before data was
               received.

       EINTR   The receive was interrupted by delivery of a  sig­
               nal before any data were available.

       EINVAL  Invalid argument passed.
