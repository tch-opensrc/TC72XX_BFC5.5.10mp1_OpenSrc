<h1>
eCos TCP/IP Networking Tests and Examples</h1></center>
A number of test/example programs are currently provided with the TCP/IP
networking package.&nbsp; These are not "tests" in the traditional eCos
test suite sense, but rather simple programs which exercise various parts
of the networking stack.&nbsp; Also included are a set of performance tests,
used to measure throughput and latency in an embedded eCos system.
<p>The following paragraphs list the various tests and how they might be
used.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are enumerated in the order in which they should
be run to verify a system configuration.
<p>Note: none of these tests are built by default.&nbsp; The user must
enable the <b><tt>CYGPKG_NET_BUILD_TESTS </tt></b>option and then "<tt>make
tests</tt>" to create them for the target environment.&nbsp; Also, these
tests require that the hardware interfaces be configured to use either
BOOTP or static initialization methods.
<h3>
mbuf_test.c</h3>
This should be the first test run on a new system.&nbsp; It simply tests
that the networking system can be initialized and that the internal memory
management (used by the stack) is functioning.
<h3>
socket_test.c</h3>
This test exercises some of the basic library interfaces.
<h3>
server_test.c</h3>
This test creates a server process on the target hardware which listens
on port TCP/7734.&nbsp; To verify that it is working, try to connect to
this port from some other [host] system.&nbsp; E.g. on Linux, use the command
"<tt>telnet <i>eCos</i> 7734</tt>", where "<i><tt>eCos</tt></i>" is the
name associated with the target hardware.&nbsp; Once connected, the eCos
application will respond with a "Hello" message and wait for a single line
of input text, which will be displayed on the diagnostic channel of the
target system.
<h3>
ping_test.c</h3>
This tests attempts to issue an ICMP "echo" request to the "server" host
(provided as part of the BOOTP or static configuration information).&nbsp;
The output will be similar to the analogous Linux program, "<tt>ping</tt>".&nbsp;
The test program also attempts to ping an additional host whose IP address
is the server IP+32.&nbsp; This second test is present to verify that the
ICMP (actually <tt>receive</tt>) time-out mechanism is working (assuming
that the second host is non-existent).
<h3>
ftp_test.c</h3>
This test attempts to make a connection to an FTP server, assuming the
default server host.&nbsp; This is an additional test which verifies that
the basic TCP functionality is working.
<h3>
nc_test_master.c</h3>

<h3>
nc_test_slave.c</h3>
This pair of programs can be used to measure throughput and latencies in
the target system.&nbsp; While both programs have been written in such
a way that they can be built and used on either Linux or eCos, the primary
use will be to run the "<tt>nc_test_master</tt>" program on a Linux host
and the "<tt>nc_test_slave</tt>" on the target hardware.&nbsp; If run in
this configuration, the master program will attempt to connect to the slave
and make various measurements using both UDP and TCP protocols.&nbsp; Additionally,
measurements will be made on an eCos slave of the actual CPU utilization
by the networking stack.
<p>To build the Linux versions, simply execute (in the eCos source tree,
not the install tree):
<blockquote><tt>make -f make.linux</tt></blockquote>

<h3>
tcp_echo.c</h3>

<h3>
tcp_sink.c</h3>

<h3>
tcp_source.c</h3>
This set of programs is similar to the <i><tt>nc_test_XXX</tt></i> programs
described above.&nbsp; However, they are designed to measure overall throughput
of the eCos system.&nbsp; The setup allows for one Linux host to run "<tt>tcp_source
<i>eCos</i></tt>" and another Linux host to run "<tt>tcp_sink <i>eCos</i></tt>".&nbsp;
The "<tt>tcp_echo</tt>" program is run on the target hardware.&nbsp; The
tests then measure the throughput and latency of sending TCP data from
one host, though the eCos target system and on to another host.&nbsp; Note:
the two Linux host systems may be the same computer in which case this
becomes a single wire echo test.&nbsp; This test suite is unique in that
it attempts to load the target system down with additional background processing
at various levels.&nbsp; This is done to simulate a real world environment
where the networking is ancillary to the main processing on the target
system.
