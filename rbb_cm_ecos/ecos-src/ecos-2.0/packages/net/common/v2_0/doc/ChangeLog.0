	* prepare-manpages.sh: Use groff -Tascii -mandoc instead of nroff -man.
	* tcpip-manpages.sgml: Regenerate.

	* tcpip.sgml: Give every chapter/part/sect1 an ID.

2001-12-17  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@galassi.org>

	* prepare-manpages.sh: fixed a little bug: the sed commands were
	being called in the wrong order so that & was converted to &amp;
	after < was converted to &lt;, with the result that < was being
	converted to &amp;lt; which is wrong.  On top of that I had a typo
	of &gt; instead of &lt;

	* tcpip-old-manpage-chapter.sgml: old deprecated stuff which I'm
	saving off for now.  It's been replaced by the prepare-manpages.sh
	script which generates the tcpip-manpages.sgml file.

	* tcpip.sgml: took out the old ugly man pages and included the
	auto-generated tcpip-manpages.sgml file instead.

	* manpages: directory with all the raw tcp/ip man pages.

	* prepare-manpages.sh: cute script to get the raw man pages from
	the "manpages" directory and prepare a tcpip-manpages.sgml file
	which has each man page in its own section.

	* tcpip.sgml: added legal and contact info front matter.

	* tcpip.sgml: Mostly cosmetic fixes revealed by comparing against the
	original non-docbook version.

2001-11-19  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@galassi.org>

	* tcpip.sgml: two small items found upon visual inspection.

	* tcpip.sgml: made a proper list out of a bad one.

	* tcpip.sgml: some more work to address Jonathan's comments.

2001-11-18  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@galassi.org>

	* tcpip.sgml: started addressing Jonathan's comments on this
	document.

	* man-page-send.sgml, man-page-select.sgml: added a couple of man
	pages converted to DocBook.  They are kind of primitive.

2001-10-31  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@galassi.org>

	* tcpip.sgml: now contains the normalized document.  It is the
	basis for future work.

	* tcpip-not-normalized.sgml: now contains the original hand-edited
	document.  It is now deprecated.

2001-10-26  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@galassi.org>

	* tcpip.sgml: now it all validates, but it's kludgy because the
	man pages should be converted to something.

2001-10-25  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@galassi.org>

	* tcpip.sgml: started structuring this document.
