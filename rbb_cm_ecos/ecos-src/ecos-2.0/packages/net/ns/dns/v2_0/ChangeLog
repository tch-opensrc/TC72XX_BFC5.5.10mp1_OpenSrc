2003-03-03  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* tests/dns1.c: Use BOOTP info where possible in preference to
	(likely incorrect!) hardcoded info. Use non-Red Hat test
	addresses.

	* tests/dns2.c: Use non-Red Hat test addresses. And don't check
	BOOTP-derived domainname as we don't know what it should be!

2003-02-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/dns.cdl: Add doc link.

2003-01-22  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* doc/dns.sgml: Use correct (and working!) docbook.

2003-01-18  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* include/dns_impl.inl (setdomainname): define with const name
	argument.
	* include/dns.h: Ditto.
	* doc/dns.sgml: Document const in setdomainname proto here.

2003-01-10  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* cdl/dns.cdl: Added the ability to hard code a domain name.
	Inspired by Motoya Kurotsu.
	* doc/dns.sgml: Documentation for this.
	
2003-01-10  Motoya Kurotsu <kurotsu@allied-telesis.co.jp>

        * tests/dns2.c: Verify domain name from the DHCP server with
	_LOOKUP_DOMAINNAME, not _DNS_IP which is the address of the DNS
	server.

2003-01-09  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* cdl/dns.cdl: Added the ability to hard code a DNS server
	address into the image which is used as the default.
	* doc/dns.sgml: Documentation for this.

2002-10-18  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/dns.cdl: Move CYGBLD_ISO_DNS_HEADER requires in with
	CYGINT_ISO_DNS which is where it should always be beside.

2002-10-11  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* cdl/dns.cdl: If CYGPKG_NS_DNS_BUILD is disable we don't
	implement the CYGINT_ISO_DNS interface.

2002-08-29  Roland Caﬂebohm <roland.cassebohm@visionsystems.de>

        * include/dns_priv.h: Make dns_header structure endian dependent.

        * include/dns_impl.inl: Don't use htons() for bitfields <= 8 bit.
        Change the way setting the type and class fields in build_query()
        to work with big-endian.

2002-05-30  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/dns.c: fixed index->ptdindex oversight.

2002-05-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/dns.c (free_hent): Actually free hent itself!

2002-05-23  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/dns.cdl (CYGPKG_NS_DNS_BUILD): Require thread destructors in
	kernel.
	* include/dns_impl.inl: Instead of using cyg_thread_get_data
	and _set_data directly, instead use store_hent and free_stored_hent
	defined by includer.
	* src/dns.c: Define store_hent() and free_stored_hent() and make
	them use thread destructors thus fixing a memory leak.

2002-05-14  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/dns2.c: Fix warning.

2002-02-22  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* doc/dns.sgml: New file.  Documentation separated from monolithic
	network component.

2002-02-01  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/dns.c (cyg_dns_res_init): Need valid value for sin_len.

2002-01-31  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/dns.cdl: Don't build tests if no DNS!

2001-12-06  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/dns.c (cyg_dns_res_init): Allow this to be called more than
	once.  The DHCP client will do this when interfaces YoYo.
	Restarting requires closing the socket (if any) and freeing the
	per-thread-data slot number.

	* include/dns_impl.inl (setdomainname): Allow the name to be
	cleared.  Check for NULL pointers variously before checking for
	valid pointer asserts.

	* tests/dns2.c: New file: Test the DNS configuration via DHCP.

	* tests/dns1.c: Initially clear the domainname.
	
2001-11-29  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/dns.c: Rename index -> ptdindex to avoid conflict with BSD
	index() function.
	* include/dns_impl.inl: Ditto.

2001-09-28  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/dns1.c (_DNS_IP): Changed to IP used in farm.

2001-09-27  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/dns_priv.h: Added DNS_REPLY definitions.

	* include/dns_impl.inl: Handle NXDomain returns.

	* include/dns_impl.inl: Added tracing.
	* src/dns.c: Same.

2001-09-26  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/dns1.c (dns_test): Use hstrerror instead of strerror.

	* include/dns.h: Added h_errno support.
	* include/dns_impl.inl: Use h_errno instead of errno. Added
	hstrerror(). Make hostname lookups before hostname.domainmain
	lookups.

2001-09-25  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/dns.h: Moved some more defs to..
	* include/dns_priv.h: ...here.

	* src/dns-priv.h: [deleted]
	* include/dns_priv.h: [added]
	
	* tests/dns1.c: Include netdb.h instead of dns.h.

	* src/dns.c: Moved all DNS protocol functions into
	dns_impl.inl. Allow for RedBoot to share the implementation with a
	smaller overhead.
	* include/dns_impl.inl: Added.

	* cdl/dns.cdl: Moved compile statement and requirements into
	CYGPKG_NS_DNS_BUILD option which can be forced off by RedBoot.
	Moved headers to cyg/ns/dns.

	* src/dns.c (alloc_hent, free_hent, alloc_string, free_string):
	Added these wrapper functions for malloc/free calls - allow easier
	maintaining of cloned function in RedBoot which uses static
	variables for storage. Incidently removed a little code
	duplication.

	* include/dns.h: Only include exported information.
	* src/dns-priv.h: Everything else moved to this file.

	* cdl/dns.cdl: Added feature requirements and CYGINT_ISO_DNS
	magic.

	* include/dns.h: Renamed res_init to cyg_dns_res_init.
	* src/dns.c: Same.
	* tests/dns1.c: Same.

	* src/dns.c: Use drv_api mutex, removed some include statements.
	* include/dns.h: Provide hostent definition and function
	declarations.
	
	* tests/dns1.c: Use cambridge.redhat.com addresses. Changed to
	output PASS/FAIL.

	* src/dns.c (parse_answer): On PTR lookups, alloc space for
	in_addr, so caller can copy data there. Fix gethostbyaddr() to
	do so.
	Note that error values do not match gethostbyaddr(3).

2001-09-20  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/dns.c: More cosmetic changes, a few htons -> ntohs changes,
	reducing size of critical section a few places, rely on
	build_query setting errno, and set errno when getdomainname can't
	copy domain name out due to size limitation.

2001-09-19  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/dns1.c (dns_test): Fix inet_aton check.
	* src/dns.c: A few comment and cosmetic changes.

2001-09-18  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/dns.c: Added DNS code contributed by Andrew Lunn
	<andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>
	* include/dns.h: Same.
	* tests/dns1.c: Same.
