These files were originally obtained from KAME, via
  kame-20020107-netbsd152-snap.tgz
(i.e. a KAME snapshot of FreeBSD 4.4, taken on Jan 7, 2002)

The original files (and updates) were imported into the eCos
tree via this process:
  cd /tmp
  gzip -d <kame-20020107-netbsd152-snap.tgz | tar -xpf -
  cd kame/freebsd/sys
  XXX=*THIS DOCUMENTATION DIRECTORY*
  xargs -t -n2 <${XXX}/BSD_FILE_LIST ${XXX}/copy_files.sh

This creates a directory tree suitable for starting as an
eCos package.  This can then be imported into the eCos tree
via:
  cd /tmp/bsd_tcpip/current
  cvs -d ECOS_CVS import -m 'import of FreeBSD 4.4 networking stack' -ko ecc/ecc/net/bsd_tcpip/current NET FreeBSD_4_4

Be sure and edit the list of files if any new files from the
network distribution is added to the eCos codebase.
