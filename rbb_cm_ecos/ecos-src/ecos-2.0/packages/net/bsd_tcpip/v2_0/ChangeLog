2003-04-29  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/ecos/support.c (cyg_net_malloc): Honour the M_ZERO
	flag. Otherwise we get random junk in places we don't want it.

2003-03-14  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/sys/net/if.c (if_attach): Removed printf which causes the
	ethernet device to become corrupt. At this point the app driver
	has started but not completed taking over from the redboot
	driver. It is unsafe for redboot to use the ethernet device.

2003-02-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/freebsd_net.cdl: Fix doc link.

2003-02-18  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/freebsd_net.cdl: Remove unused NBPFILTER and BRIDGE CDL options.

2003-02-14  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* doc/freebsd.sgml: new_net template is now just "net".

2003-02-12  Jani Monoses  <jani@iv.ro>

	* src/sys/kern/sockio.c: bsd_getinfo/bsd_setinfo should have
	void * args. Silences warnings.
	* src/sys/kern/uipc_socket.c (sopoll): Use __FUNCTION__ correctly
	for GCC 3.x.
	* src/sys/net/if_ethersubr.c: Put comments for stuff after endifs
	to silence warnings.
	* src/sys/net/if_loop.c: Ditto.

2003-02-04  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* include/sys/bsdtypes.h: Workaround when building with new
	Linux compatability package (which over-defines some symols
	defined in this module).

2002-12-03  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/ecos/support.c (show_network_tables): New function to
	print information about network tables (interfaces, routing).

2002-11-12  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/ecos/timeout.c (callout_reset): Check for finding the
	correct "delta" was wrong - only used with asserts enabled.

	* include/sys/uio.h: Compatability wrapper to expose 'iovec'
	functions - used by many network programs.

2002-11-04  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/sys/net/if.c (if_attach): Moved check for ifq_maxlen to
	this function since it can't be checked until the device comes
	online, which may not be a sysinit time for PCMCIA devices.

2002-11-03  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/sys/kern/sockio.c (bsd_getname): Fix error where getsockname()
	was actually performing getpeername().

	* include/sys/uio.h: New file - compatability wrapper.

2002-07-31  Gary Thomas  <gary@chez-thomas.org>

	* src/sys/netinet/in_cksum.c: Fix problem on big endian machines.

2002-07-26  Gary Thomas  <gary@chez-thomas.org>
2002-07-26  Ken Cox <jkc@redhat.com>

	* src/ecos/support.c (ovbcopy): ovbcopy() must handle the case 
	where the src and dst regions are overlayed.  memcpy() does not 
	handle this case, but memmove() does.

2002-07-10  Gary Thomas  <gary@chez-thomas.org>

	* src/sys/netinet/udp_usrreq.c: 
	* src/sys/netinet/tcp_subr.c: 
	* src/sys/netinet/in_pcb.c: Rename 'errno' function parameter
	since some compilers have problems with this.

2002-07-08  Gary Thomas  <gary@chez-thomas.org>

	* include/sys/param.h: Need <errno.h> which may or may not be
	already present, depending on configuration.

2002-06-20  Gary Thomas  <gary@chez-thomas.org>

	* include/sys/param.h (sprintf): Map to diag_sprintf().

2002-06-14  Gary Thomas  <gary@chez-thomas.org>

	* src/ecos/support.c: 
	Fix compile errors when CYGDBG_NET_TIMING_STATS enabled.

2002-06-05  Gary Thomas  <gary@chez-thomas.org>

	* include/netinet/in.h: Rename 'ip_opts' field (using the same
	name as the structure is illegal in C++).

2002-05-14  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/netinet6/in6.h: Fixed warnings.

2002-04-22  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/sys/netinet6/nd6.c: Make debug (on) default.

	* include/netinet/tcp_debug.h: Fully conditionalize debug facility.

2002-04-17  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/sys/socket.h: Remove definitions only used by sysctl
	since their presence could be misleading.

	* src/ecos/support.c (STACK_SIZE): Remove [debug/testing] bloat.

2002-03-30  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/machine/types.h: [Placeholder] needed for some compilers.

2002-03-28  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/sys/netinet/ip_icmp.c: 
	* include/sys/param.h: 
	* include/netinet/icmp_var.h: Export status structure for SNMP.

	* cdl/freebsd_net.cdl: Augment log facilities to what SNMP uses.

2002-03-27  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/sys/param.h (log): Remove warning.

2002-03-25  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/ecos/support.c (zinit): Add more record keeping (and debug
	prints) for zones.

	* src/ecos/timeout.c (do_timeout): Don't reset ACTIVE when running
	a timeout (since it confuses the TCP timer code).

2002-03-23  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/sys/netinet/in_cksum.c (in_addword): Changed to use uint32 since
	uint64 was wasteful (and failed on some architectures!)

2002-03-20  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/sys/socket.h: Force struct sockaddr to be at least as
	big as IPv4 or IPv6 sockets.  Possibly this could be a little
	cleaner, but at least now it's safe for programs to use sockaddr
	variables in either environment.

2002-03-11  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com> 

	[Case 107110]

	* src/sys/netinet/in.c (in_control): SIOCSIFADDR switch entry
	moved to before the scan for this same address being in the list
	already, along with Add and Delete (SIOCAIFADDR,SIOCDIFADDR) arms.
	It falls through into the same alloc-if-needed code anyway.
	Thus repeatedly setting the same address does not leak store.

	* src/sys/net/route.c (route_reinit): Rewrite to delete all routes
	individually rather than en-masse (leaking store).
	(rt_reinit_rtdelete): New function; callback for individual
	deletion.
	(rtioctl): Do not pass in a "route **" to return a pointer to the
	route removed or added; this results in an extra reference, by the
	returned pointer, and so a storeleak.
	(rtrequest): RTM_DELETE arm: do not free a gateway route if the
	gateway pointer is the same as the route itself - it gets freed
	*again* at the end of the routine if you do.  Just dec the refcnt.

2002-03-08  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/sys/net/if_loop.c (loioctl): Force IFF_LOOPBACK setting.

	* src/sys/kern/uipc_mbuf.c: Remove some warnings [from munging].

	* src/ecos/support.c (cyg_net_init): Identify init messages.

	* include/sys/param.h (nstab,nstab_end): These are not defined
	within the network package and thus should not be munged.

	* include/net/if.h: Add "IFF_LOOPBACK" to set of flags which
	cannot be changed outside the kernel.  Note: this is a change
	from the "normal" BSD code.  It was done to keep old code
	working, but it may break some new code.

2002-03-07  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/sys/kern/uipc_mbuf.c: Work over for the namespace changes.

	* include/sys/param.h: Complete namespace munging; privatize
	all kernel symbols via "cyg_" prefix.

2002-02-05  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* cdl/freebsd_net.cdl: Position this package below CYGPKG_NET
	ie. the common networking package.  Only affects the view in the
	GUI CT, no big deal.
