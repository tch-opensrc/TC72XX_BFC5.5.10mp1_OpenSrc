Installing RedBoot on Fujitsu FRV400 system.

Orient the motherboard like this:

For the switches, x is down (on this diagram), o is up and X
will be both.

There is also a ribbon cable from the CPU board to the serial
connectors.  Orient this cable so that the red stripe connects
to pin R1 and is at the bottom of the CPU board.  Directions
are in the hardware installation guide, but this part wasn't
terribly clear to me.

1. Bring up the existing Fujitsu board monitor.

   Attach a serial cable to the top serial port - 38400/8N1.
   Make sure that SW1-1 (X above) is up.
   Turn on power.  You will also have to press the RED button.

2. Download RedBoot into the FLASH.

   Using the attached programs (minicom has a terrible time
   with ASCII downloads - use these instead), download the
   frv.ROM image.  Use these commands

      Would you like to check SDRAM and SRAM ? (Y/N) : n

      >r 3f00000
      Flash ROM : IC7. OK ? (Y/N) Y
      Blank check
      Blank error !! Erase ? (Y/N) Y
      Erase..
      Work memory clear
      Hex Data Offset Address=0x03F00000
      Recieve....
  
   At this point, send the file frv.ROM using simple ASCII protocol.
   Since minicom does this poorly, I use the attached 'dl_slow' script.
   I set up minicom like this:

mqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqj

   You'll know if the file is being transferred correctly by the LEDs doing a
   little address dance (i.e. they are showing the address being loaded).

   When the download completes, you may need to hit 'enter' a couple of times.
   Then you should see:
      Write Start...
      Write OK!
      Verify Start...
      Verify OK!
      Complete !!

   At this point, change SW1-1 to be down (x).  Press reset (the bottom blue
   button on the CPU).  You should get:

      +FLASH configuration checksum error or invalid key

   Be sure and run 'fis init'.

Notes:

* There are two FLASH devices on the motherboard.  Using SW1-1, they swap
  memory addresses.  We use one (IC7) and the Fujitsu loader uses the other.
  I see no reason (ATM) to replace the Fujitsu monitor other than to let
  RedBoot be the primary.  This way, reverting SW1-1, at least you can always
  reprogram RedBoot.

  CAUTION!! Do not change SW1-1 until after you've programmed RedBoot.  If
  you do it beforehand, you'll overwrite the Fujitsu monitor.
