	* src/quicc_smc1.c (cyg_hal_smcx_init_channel): 
	(cyg_hal_sccx_init_channel): 

	* src/cpm.c: Include <string.h> for memset().
	(_mpc8xx_reset_cpm): use CPM busy flag to check reset completion.
	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Include <string.h> for memset().
	(cyg_hal_smcx_init_channel): Don't reset CPM here - let variant
	initialization do it. Only let through RX interrupts.
	(cyg_hal_sccx_init_channel): Ditto.

2003-03-06  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/cpm.c: Handle case where DPRAM allocation is unknown.
	
	* include/ppc8xx.h: Define limits of CPM/DPRAM space.

2003-03-05  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Need to flush data cache because the serial
	driver may set use buffers in cacheable memory.  Without this,
	diag_printf() falls over if the serial driver is ever used.

	* src/cpm.c: New file with CPM/DPRAM support.

	* include/ppc8xx.h: 
	* cdl/hal_powerpc_quicc.cdl: Split out support for CPM/DPRAM.

2002-11-26  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Initialize BD allocation point.  Note that it is
	different from when the CPM get's reset directly.  This is to allow
	sharing of the space between ROM (RedBoot) code and applications.

	* cdl/hal_powerpc_quicc.cdl: Move platform define here, where it belongs.

2002-11-25  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Support any combination of SMC1/SMC2 and
	SCC1/SCC2/SCC3 [or at least lay foundation for it]

	* cdl/hal_powerpc_quicc.cdl: Add more controls over port layout.

2002-07-18  Gary Thomas  <gary@chez-thomas.org>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (cyg_hal_scc1_init_channel): Fix init which
	failed from power-up - wrong channel in CP command!

2002-07-11  Gary Thomas  <gary@chez-thomas.org>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: 
	* include/quicc_smc1.h: 
	* cdl/hal_powerpc_quicc.cdl: Add support for SCC1 as a serial
	console (for newer chips which have this available).

2002-06-25  Gary Thomas  <gary@chez-thomas.org>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: 
	* cdl/hal_powerpc_quicc.cdl: Use more common CDL name for baudrate
	CYGNUM_HAL_VIRTUAL_VECTOR_CONSOLE_CHANNEL_BAUD.

2002-05-30  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Fix warning.

2001-09-10  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_powerpc_quicc.cdl (CYGNUM_HAL_QUICC_DIAG_BAUD):
	234000->230400 typo.

2001-07-31  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>
2001-07-31  Christoph Csebits  <christoph.csebits@frequentis.com>

	* include/ppc8xx.h: 4 SCCs are supported by MPC860T, so don't
	reserve space.

2001-01-26  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Removed CYGSEM_HAL_VIRTUAL_VECTOR_DIAG check. 

2001-01-15  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Provide for multiple serial input buffers
	since the single buffer/descriptor model fails miserably on some
	newer chips [at least 855T].

2001-01-03  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/ppc8xx.h: Layout of I2C and IDMA was [slightly] wrong.

2000-08-30  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (cyg_hal_plf_serial_init_channel): Move all
	init code to init_channel.

2000-06-30  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: calling i/f macro changes.

2000-06-28  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/quicc_smc1.h: 
	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Cleanup.

2000-06-26  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/quicc_smc1.h:
	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Added non-block/timout features. Reworked
	Ctrl-c support code.

2000-06-22  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Fix compiler warning. Add functions to deal
	with ctrl-c interrupts from the device.

2000-06-21  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: 
	* include/quicc_smc1.h: 
	Allow callers to specify base. Added code to initialize vector
	procs table.

2000-06-16  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (hal_ctrlc_isr): Check that interrupt is
	generated by serial controller.

2000-06-13  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c:
	* include/quicc_smc1.h:
	Added ctrlc handling for use via virtual vector table.

2000-03-03  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Use common CPM defines (now in ppc8xx.h).

	* include/ppc8xx.h: Add some generic defines for CPM.  Also
	refine ucode area for easier use (someday).

start-serialize-newcdl
2000-02-29  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (UART_BAUD_RATE): Use CDL option for baud rate.

	* cdl/hal_powerpc_quicc.cdl: Add option to control diag serial
	baud rate, rather than being fixed at 38400.

end-serialize-newcdl
2000-02-21  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (UART_BIT_RATE): Handle system clock speeds
	which are not integer multiples of MHz, e.g. 33.33 MHz.

2000-02-04  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (cyg_quicc_smc1_uart_rcvchar): Get frequency
	from new CYGHWR_HAL_POWERPC_BOARD_SPEED variable.

2000-02-03  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

1999-09-02  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (init_smc1_uart): Generalize baud rate computation.

1999-09-01  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/ppc8xx.h: Add some missing definitions (MAR, MBMR).

1999-06-27  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Many changes which allow these routines to
	cooperate when the SMC is being used by a serial "driver" as well.
	In particular, remove "hard coded" resources on the SMC.
	Note: there is some lingering problem with the transmit routines
	[globally] after the serial driver re-inits the SMC.  Of course
	this problem is intermittent, so it's hard to fix.

1999-06-24  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (cyg_hal_gdb_isr): Add this routine to trap ^C
	events and stop the system, if CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_BREAK_SUPPORT.

1999-06-24  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (cyg_quicc_init_smc1): Remove unused, commented
	out code, that was left over from CygMon version of this file.

1999-06-18  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (init_smc1_uart): Use default 38400 Baud,
	because it is better.

1999-06-18  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (init_smc1_uart): Initialize the baud rate
	depending on the system clock setting.

1999-06-15  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Moved include of ppc8xx.h

	* src/ppc8xx.h: Removed, to...

	* include/ppc8xx.h: New file.  Moved here so that platform startup
	code can share it.

1999-06-10  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Make this file safe for compilation even when
	no PowerPC 860 is in use; pkgconf can enable this component for
	any target, potentially.

1999-06-10  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* ChangeLog: Component created, based partly on the FADS work and
	on CygMon's serial IO code for the MBX860, to support the Motorola
	MBX860 QUICC serial controller for basic IO.
	Initially only used in the neighbouring platform component
	HAL_POWERPC_MBX [hal/powerpc/mbx/....] 

	* include/quicc_smc1.h
	* include/pkgconf/hal_quicc.h
