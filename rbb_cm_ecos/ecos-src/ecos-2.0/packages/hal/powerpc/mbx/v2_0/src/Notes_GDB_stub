How to build and install the GDB module on the MBX board

Make GDB module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Configure and build using the 'stubs_old_scheme' template for the MBX
target. These are the necessary CLI instructions. It can also be done
from the Configtool by selecting the appropriate templates.

 % cd /tmp
 % mkdir stubs
 % cd stubs
 % ecosconfig new mbx stubs_old_scheme
 % ecosconfig tree
 % make

This will install some files in ./install/bin:

 cygmon.img:   The built stubs image
 cygmon.bin:   The image converted to binary (suitable for burning to ROM)
 cygmon.srec:  The S-Record image (suitable for flash programming, see below)


Prepare board for flash programming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This assumes you have EPPC-Bug in the on-board flash. This can be determined
by setting up the board according to the below instructions and powering
up the board. The EPPC-Bug prompt should appear on the SMC1 connector at
9600 baud, 8N1.

 1. Set jumper 3 to 2-3     [allow XU2 flash to be programmed]
 2. Set jumper 4 to 2-3     [boot EPPC-Bug]


Program FLASH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 1. Prepare EPPC-Bug for download:

       EPPC-Bug>lo 0

    At this point the monitor is ready for input. It will not return the
    prompt until the file has been downloaded.

 2. Use the terminal emulator's ASCII download feature (or a simple clipboard
    copy/paste operation) to download the gdb_module.srec data.

     Note: On Linux, Minicom's ASCII download feature seems to be broken.
           A workaround is to load the file into emacs (or another editor)
           and copy the full contents to the clipboard. Then press the
           mouse paste-button (usually middle) over the Minicom window.

 3. Program the flash with the downloaded data:

       EPPC-Bug>pflash 40000 60000 fc000000

 4. Switch off the power, and change jumper 4 to 1-2. Turn on the power
    again. The board should now boot using the newly programmed stubs.
