	* src/vectors.S:
	Don't use .file as it can confuse debugging since the .file
	doesn't contain the path and therefore the debugger will never
	know where it lives! This conflicts with using -Wa,--gstabs.

	* src/hal_syscall.c (hal_syscall_handler): Add extra sig argument to
	__do_syscall.

	added to the ASB2305 platform.

2001-10-16  David Howells  <dhowells@redhat.com>

	one automatically.

2000-11-30  Drew Moseley  <dmoseley@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_arch.h: Handle Cygmon interrupt stack.  ie For
	Cygmon we must switch to a new stack immediately on exception to

        PR 17153

	* src/vectors.S (__default_interrupt_vsr): Pass correct vector
	value to isr.

1998-09-09  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_arch.h:
	Removed distinction between interrupt and thread switch contexts
	in HAL_SavedRegisters. Modified appropriate macros to reflect this.

	state saved by interrupt and exception handlers. This makes
	supporting thread-aware debugging easier.

	* src/vectors.S:

	Now place arg3 of interrupt_end() in correct stack slot.

1998-09-04  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

1998-09-02  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S:
	Moved NMI and TRAP VSRs down 1 word to match cygmon's use of the
	vector table. This may need to change back in the future.

1998-09-01  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_intr.h:
	Added CYG_VSR_COUNT, CYG_EXCEPTION_COUNT and CYG_ISR_COUNT.
	Modified HAL_TRANSLATE_VECTOR() for mn103002 to provide slots
	for the NMI vectors at start of hal_interrupt_* tables.

	* src/hal_misc.c (exception_handler):
	Added support for decoding NMI vectors and for calling watchdog
	ISR if present.

	* src/vectors.S:
	Modified behaviour of __default_nmi_vsr to support watchdog timer
	properly.
	Fixed indirection bug in __nmi and __trap.
	Modified offsets in hal_interrupt_* tables to provide slots for
	NMI vectors at start in mn103002.

	rename __main() to cyg_hal_invoke_constructors() and remove
	initialised test

	Change call of __main() to cyg_hal_invoke_constructors(), and call
	of main() to cyg_start()

1998-08-25  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	Now pass pointer to saved registers as third argument to

	* src/hal_misc.c:
	Added calls to turn the caches on. But disabled them
	since they interact poorly with Cygmon (Cygmon does not
	flush the caches when setting/clearing breakpoints).

Wed Aug 19 18:19:32 1998  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>
