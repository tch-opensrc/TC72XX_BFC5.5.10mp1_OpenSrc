	* include/platform.inc: Fix memory size test. Reduce wait counts
	for chip select 3 (16550 uart).
	* misc/redboot_FLASH.ecm: Turn off hw flow control on 16550.
	* misc/redboot_FULLRAM.ecm: Ditto.
	* misc/redboot_RAM.ecm: Ditto.
	* misc/redboot_ROM.ecm: Ditto.

	* cdl/hal_mn10300_am33_asb2305.cdl: Add support for CPU serial ports.
	* src/ser_asb.c: Support configurations no 16550 and with
	builtin AM33 serial ports.

2002-12-06  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_mn10300_am33_asb2305.cdl (CYG_HAL_FULL_RAM): New option to
	indicate if RAM startup should use all RAM. This allows a special
	RAM startup to be built which may be loaded onto a bare board by
	the MEI tools. This can be used to build an initial RedBoot which
	is used to program the flash with the ROM startup RedBoot image.
	Implement CYGINT_HAL_MN10300_MEM_REAL_REGION_TOP.

	* misc/redboot_FULLRAM.ecm:
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_mn10300_am33_asb2305_fullram.h:

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_mn10300_am33_asb2305_ram.mlt: Move ram base
	so that ROM based RedBoot can load it.
