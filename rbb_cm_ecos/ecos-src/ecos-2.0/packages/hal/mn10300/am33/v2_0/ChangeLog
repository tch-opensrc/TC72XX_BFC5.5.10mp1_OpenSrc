2003-04-10  Nick Garnett  <nickg@balti.calivar.com>

	* src/mn10300_am33.ld: 
	Added .eh_frame to data section. This is a stopgap fix to allow
	C++ programs that define exceptions to link and run. It does not
	allow them to actually throw exceptions, since that depends on
	compiler changes that have not been made. Further, more
	far-reaching, linker script changes will also be needs when that
	happens.
	Added libsupc++.a to GROUP() directive for GCC versions later than
	3.0.
