>Description</H2
><P
>In some ways writing a device driver for the synthetic target is very
similar to writing one for a real target. Obviously it has to provide
the standard interface for that class of device, so for example an
ethernet device has to provide <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>can_send</TT
>,
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>send</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>recv</TT
> and similar
functions. Many devices will involve interrupts, so the driver
contains ISR and DSR functions and will call
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_drv_interrupt_create</TT
>,
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_drv_interrupt_acknowledge</TT
>, and related
functions.
    </P
><P
>In other ways writing a device driver for the synthetic target is very
different. Usually the driver will not have any direct access to the
underlying hardware. In fact for some devices the I/O may not involve
real hardware, instead everything is emulated by widgets on the
graphical display. Therefore the driver cannot just peek and poke
device registers, instead it must interact with host-side code by
exchanging message. The synthetic target HAL provides a function
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>synth_auxiliary_xchgmsg</TT
> for this purpose.
    </P
><P
>Initialization of a synthetic target device driver is also very
different. On real targets the device hardware already exists when the
driver's initialization routine runs. On the synthetic target it is
first necessary to instantiate the device inside the I/O auxiliary, by
a call to <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>synth_auxiliary_instantiate</TT
>. That
function performs a special message exchange with the I/O auxiliary,
causing it to load a Tcl script for the desired type of device and run
an instantiation procedure within that script.
    </P
><P
>Use of the I/O auxiliary is optional: if the user does not specify
<TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>--io</TT
> on the command line then the auxiliary will not
be started and hence most I/O operations will not be possible. Device
drivers should allow for this possibility, for example by just
discarding any data that gets written. The HAL exports a flag
<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>synth_auxiliary_running</TT
> which should be checked.

ensures that there is a clearly defined point at which the I/O
auxiliary knows that all required devices have been loaded. It can
then perform various consistency checks and clean-ups, run the user's
<TT

visible.

>Interrupt Handling</H2

>Interrupt handling in the synthetic target is much the same as on a
real target. An interrupt object is created using
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>cyg_drv_interrupt_create</TT
>, attached, and unmasked.
The emulated device - in other words the Tcl script running inside the
I/O auxiliary - can raise an interrupt. Subject to interrupts being
disabled and the appropriate vector being masked, the system will
invoke the specified ISR function. The synthetic target HAL
implementation does have some limitations: there is no support for
nested interrupts, interrupt priorities, or a separate interrupt
stack. Supporting those might be appropriate when targetting a
simulator that attempts to model real hardware accurately, but not for
the simple emulation provided by the synthetic target.
    </P
><P
>Of course the actual implementation of the ISR and DSR functions will
be rather different for a synthetic target device driver. For real
hardware the device driver will interact with the device by reading
and writing device registers, managing DMA engines, and the like. A
synthetic target driver will instead call
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>synth_auxiliary_xchgmsg</TT
> to perform the I/O
operations.
    </P
><P
>There is one other significant difference between interrupt handling
on the synthetic target and on real hardware. Usually the eCos code
will know which interrupt vectors are used for which devices. That
information is fixed when the target hardware is designed. With the
synthetic target interrupt vectors are assigned to devices on the host
side, either via the target definition file or dynamically when the
device is instantiated. Therefore the initialization code for a
target-side device driver will need to request interrupt vector
information from the host-side, via a message exchange. Such interrupt
vectors will be in the range 1 to 31 inclusive, with interrupt 0 being
reserved for the real-time clock.
