>To get the full functionality of the synthetic target, users must
build and install the I/O auxiliary ecosynth and various support
files. It is possible to develop applications for the synthetic target
without the auxiliary, but only limited I/O facilities will be
available. The relevant code resides in the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>host</TT
> subdirectory of the synthetic target
architectural HAL package, and building it involves the standard
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>configure</B

CLASS="COMMAND"

>, and
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make install</B
> steps.
    </P
><P
>There are two main ways of building the host-side software. It is
possible to build both the generic host-side software and all
package-specific host-side software, including the I/O auxiliary. in a
single build tree. This involves using the
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>configure</B
> script at the toplevel of the eCos
repository, which will automatically search the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>packages</TT
> hierarchy for host-side
software. For more information on this, see the
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>README.host</TT
> file at the top of the repository.
Note that if you have an existing build tree which does not include
the synthetic target architectural HAL package then it will be
necessary to rerun the toplevel configure script: the search for
appropriate packages happens at configure time.
    </P
><P
>The alternative is to build just the host-side for this package.
This involves creating a suitable build directory and running the
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>configure</B

the source tree is not allowed.

essential that the <TT

<TT

locate and execute the I/O auxiliary ecosynth.
    </P

>Because ecosynth is run automatically by an eCos application rather
than explicitly by the user, it is not installed in the <TT

installed below <TT

together with various support files such as images. At configure time
it is usually possible to specify an alternative location for
<TT

<TT
CLASS="OPTION"

<TT
CLASS="OPTION"

be used for this package because the eCos application is built
completely separately and does not know how the host-side was
configured.

NAME="SYNTH-TOOLS"

><H2
>Toolchain</H2
><P
>When developing eCos applications for a normal embedded target it is
necessary to use a suitable cross-compiler and related tools such as
the linker. Developing for the synthetic target is easier because you
can just use the standard GNU tools (gcc, g++, ld, &#8230;) which
were provided with your Linux distribution, or which you used to build
your own Linux setup. Any reasonably recent version of the tools, for
example gcc 2.96(Red Hat) as shipped with Red Hat Linux 7, should be
sufficient.
    </P
><P
>There is one important limitation when using these tools: current gdb
will not support debugging of eCos threads on the synthetic target. As
far as gdb is concerned a synthetic target application is
indistinguishable from a normal Linux application, so it assumes that
any threads will be created by calls to the Linux
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>pthread_create</TT
> function provided by the C
library. Obviously this is not the case since the application is never
linked with that library. Therefore gdb never notices the eCos thread
mechanisms and assumes the application is single-threaded. Fixing this
is possible but would involve non-trivial changes to gdb.
    </P
><P
>Theoretically it is possible to develop synthetic target applications
on, for example, a PC running Windows and then run the resulting
executables on another machine that runs Linux. This is rarely useful:
if a Linux machine is available then usually that machine will also be
used for building ecos and the application. However, if for some
reason it is necessary or desirable to build on another machine then
this requires a suitable cross-compiler and related tools. If the
application will be running on a typical PC with an x86 processor then
a suitable configure triplet would be
<TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>i686-pc-linux-gnu</B
></TT
>. The installation
instructions for the various GNU tools should be consulted for further
information.

>Hardware Preparation</H2
><P
>Preparing a real embedded target for eCos development can be tricky.
Often the first step is to install suitable firmware, usually RedBoot.
This means creating and building a special configuration for eCos with
the RedBoot template, then somehow updating the target's flash chips
with the resulting RedBoot image. Typically it will also be necessary
to get a working serial connection, and possibly set up ethernet as
well. Although usually none of the individual steps are particularly
complicated, there are plenty of ways in which things can go wrong and
it can be hard to figure out what is actually happening. Of course
some board manufacturers make life easier for their developers by
shipping hardware with RedBoot preinstalled, but even then it is still
necessary to set up communication between host and target.
    </P
><P
>None of this is applicable to the synthetic target. Instead you can
just build a normal eCos configuration, link your application with the
resulting libraries, and you end up with an executable that you can
run directly on your Linux machine or via gdb. A useful side effect of
this is that application development can start before any real
embedded hardware is actually available.
    </P
><P
>Typically the memory map for a synthetic target application will be
set up such that there is a read-only ROM region containing all the
code and constant data, and a read-write RAM region for the data. The
default locations and sizes of these regions depend on the specific
platform being used for development. Note that the application always
executes out of ROM: on a real embedded target much of the development
would involve running RedBoot firmware there, with application code
and data loaded into RAM; usually this would change for the final
system; the firmware would be replaced by the eCos application itself,
configured for ROM bootstrap, and it would perform the appropriate
hardware initialization. Therefore the synthetic target actually
emulates the behaviour of a final system, not of a development
environment. In practice this is rarely significant, although having
the code in read-only memory can help catch some problems in
application code.
