>A target definition file is actually a Tcl script that gets run in the
main interpreter of the I/O auxiliary during initialization. This
provides a lot of flexibility if necessary. For example the script
could open a socket to a resource management server of some sort to
determine which hardware facilities are already in use and adapt
accordingly. Another possibility is to adapt based on <A
HREF="synth-new-host.html#SYNTH-NEW-HOST-ARGS"
>command line arguments</A
>. Users who
are not familiar with Tcl programming should still be able to edit a
simple target definition file without too much difficulty, using a
mixture of cut'n'paste, commenting or uncommenting various lines, and
making small edits such as changing <TT

<TT

>The documentaton for each synthetic target device should provide
details of the options available for that device, and often a suitable
fragment that can be pasted into a target definition file and edited.
There is no specific set of options that a given device will always
provide. However in practice many devices will use common code
exported by the main I/O auxiliary, or their implementation will
involve some re-use of code for an existing device. Hence certain
types of option are common to many devices.
    </P
><P
>A good example of this is filters, which control the appearance of
text output. The above target definition file defines a filter
<TT

tracing facilities when <TT
