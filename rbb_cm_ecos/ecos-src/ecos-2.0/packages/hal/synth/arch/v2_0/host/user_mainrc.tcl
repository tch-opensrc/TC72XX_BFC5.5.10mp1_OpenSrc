# This configuration file is executed by ecosynth, the eCos synthetic
# target auxiliary program, just before the application is allowed
# to continue. The target definition file has been processed and the
# GUI has been set up, although usually the event loop will not have
# been entered and no windows will have been displayed yet.
#
# This file is executed in a Tcl interpreter, so Tcl syntax applies.
