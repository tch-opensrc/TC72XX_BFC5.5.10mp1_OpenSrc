# This configuration file is executed by ecosynth, the eCos synthetic
# target auxiliary program, early on during initialization. Typically
# this file is used to set up search paths and similar variables. The
# eCos synthetic target documentation should be consulted for more

# This file is executed in a Tcl interpreter, so Tcl syntax applies.
