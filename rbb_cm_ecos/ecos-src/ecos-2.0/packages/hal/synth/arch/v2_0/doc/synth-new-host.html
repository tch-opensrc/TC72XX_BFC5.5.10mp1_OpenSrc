><H2
>Description</H2
><P
>On the host-side adding a new device means writing a Tcl/Tk script
that will handle instantiation and subsequent requests from the
target-side. These scripts all run in the same full interpreter,
extended with various commands provided by the main I/O auxiliary
code, and running in an overall GUI framework. Some knowledge of
programming with Tcl/Tk is required to implement host-side device
support.
    </P
><P
>Some devices can be implemented entirely using a Tcl/Tk script. For
example, if the final system will have some buttons then those can be
emulated in the synthetic target using a few Tk widgets. A simple
emulation could just have the right number of buttons in a row. A more
advanced emulation could organize the buttons with the right layout,
perhaps even matching the colour scheme, the shapes, and the relative
sizes. With other devices it may be necessary for the Tcl script to
interact with an external program, because the required functionality
cannot easily be accessed from a Tcl script. For example interacting
with a raw ethernet device involves some <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>ioctl</TT
>
calls, which is easier to do in a C program. Therefore the
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ethernet.tcl</TT
> script which implements the
host-side ethernet support spawns a separate program
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>rawether</TT
>, written in C, that performs the
low-level I/O. Raw ethernet access usually also requires root
privileges, and running a small program <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>rawether</TT
>
with such privileges is somewhat less of a security risk than the
whole eCos application, the I/O auxiliary, and various dynamically
loaded Tcl scripts.
    </P
><P
>Because all scripts run in a single interpreter, some care has
to be taken to avoid accidental sharing of global variables. The best
way to avoid problems is to have each script create its own Tcl
namespace, so for example the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ethernet.tcl</TT
> script
creates a namespace <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>ethernet::</TT
> and all variables
and procedures reside in this namespace. Similarly the I/O auxiliary
itself makes use of a <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>synth::</TT
> namespace.

><H2
>Building and Installation</H2
><P
>When an eCos device driver or application code instantiates a device,
the I/O auxiliary will attempt to load a matching Tcl script. The
third argument to <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>synth_auxiliary_instantiate</TT
>
specifies the type of device, for example <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ethernet</TT
>,
and the I/O auxiliary will append a <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.tcl</TT
> suffix
and look for a script <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ethernet.tcl</TT
>.
    </P
><P
>If the device being instantiated is application-specific rather than
part of an eCos package, the I/O auxiliary will look first in the
current directory, then in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>~/.ecos/synth</TT
>. If it is part of an eCos
package then the auxiliary will expect to find the Tcl script and any
support files below <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>libexec/ecos</TT
> in the install tree - note
that the same install tree must be used for the I/O auxiliary itself
and for any device driver support. The directory hierarchy below
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>libexec/ecos</TT
> matches the
structure of the eCos repository, allowing multiple versions of a
package to be installed to allow for incompatible protocol changes.
    </P
><P
>The preferred way to build host-side software is to use
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>autoconf</B
> and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>automake</B
>. Usually
this involves little more than copying the
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>acinclude.m4</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>configure.in</TT
>
and <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Makefile.am</TT
> files from an existing package,
for example the synthetic target ethernet driver, and then making
minor edits. In <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>acinclude.m4</TT
> it may be necessary
to adjust the path to the root of the repository.
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>configure.in</TT
> may require a similar change, and
the <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>AC_INIT</TT
> macro invocation will have to be
changed to match one of the files in the new package. A critical macro
in this file is <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ECOS_PACKAGE_DIRS</TT
> which will set
up the correct install directory. <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Makefile.am</TT
> may
require some more changes, for example to specify the data files that
should be installed (including the Tcl script). These files should
then be processed using <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>aclocal</B
>,
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>autoconf</B
> and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>automake</B
> in that
order. Actually building the software then just involves
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>configure</B
>, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make</B
> and
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make install</B
>, as per the instructions in the
toplevel <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>README.host</TT
> file.
    </P
><P
>To assist developers, if the environment variable
<TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>ECOSYNTH_DEVEL</TT
> is set then a slightly different
algorithm is used for locating device Tcl scripts. Instead of looking
only in the install tree the I/O auxiliary will also look in the
source tree, and if the script there is more recent than the installed
version it will be used in preference. This allows developers to
modify the master copy without having to run <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make
install</B
> all the time.
    </P
><P
>If a script needs to know where it has been installed it can examine
the Tcl variable <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>synth::device_install_dir</TT
> . This
variable gets updated whenever a  script is loaded, so if the
value may be needed later it should be saved away in a device-specific
variable.
