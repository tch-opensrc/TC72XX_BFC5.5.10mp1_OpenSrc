2002-04-29  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_cygm.S:
	Don't use .file as it can confuse debugging since the .file
	doesn't contain the path and therefore the debugger will never
	know where it lives! This conflicts with using -Wa,--gstabs.

2000-10-20  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* tests/slebtime.cxx: Ensure default priority constructors
	are called.

2000-02-16  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_sparclite_sleb.cdl: removed fix me

2000-02-07  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_sparclite_sleb.cdl: use cpu options when linking.

2000-02-04  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_sparclite_sleb.cdl (define_proc): Add output of a
	#define for CYGHWR_HAL_SPARCLITE_HAS_ASR17 - because a Fujitsu
	SPARClite does.

2000-01-24  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/*.cdl:

	Remove obsolete option CYGTST_TESTING_IDENTIFIER.

2000-01-19  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/*.cdl: Add descriptions to a number of options &c which were
	lacking same, also tidied up other typos as noticed en passant.

1999-12-20  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_sparclite_sleb.cdl: Add -Wl for linker options.

1999-11-25  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_sparclite_sleb_rom.h: 
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_sparclite_sleb_ram.h: New file(s).

1999-11-03  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_sparclite_sleb.cdl: Define build options.

1999-11-01  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_sparclite_sleb.cdl: Added.
	 Use define_proc for const header defs.
	
1999-10-14  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_sparclite_sleb_ram.mlt,
	  include/pkgconf/mlt_sparclite_sleb_rom.mlt:

	Fix .mlt files to match the latest .ldi files. ROM startup
	requires latest config tool which contains fix for PR 19799.

1999-10-13  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/hal_sparclite_sleb.h: Add CDL and
	[un]definitions for handling optional Multiple Vector Trapping and
	optional copy of vectors into RAM - when it is optional.  Also
	define CYGHWR_HAL_SPARCLITE_HAS_ASR17 so that the arch HAL
	self-configures correctly.

	* include/halboot.si: Copy trampoline code into section
	.ram_vectors at __ram_vectors_start if so configured.

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_sparclite_sleb_ram.ldi: 
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_sparclite_sleb_ram.mlt: 
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_sparclite_sleb_rom.ldi: 
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_sparclite_sleb_rom.mlt: 
	Link in new variable size, sometimes 0 size, ram_vectors section;
	this does away with the need to fib about the size of RAM, it was
	previously defined to start at 0x4000200 to reserve a bit for
	trampoline code.
	(comment from the example .ldi files...)
	The ram_vectors section is to allow some free space to copy
	vectors into from the ROM.  This is required to be variable size
	to accomodate SVT or MVT; 80 bytes vs 4kB.  Copying is not
	necessary with MVT, but it is optional because it may offer
	performance gains.  Copying is required for SVT because the
	(aligned) start of ROM contains initialization instructions.  RAM
	copy is used rather than leave a big gap in the ROM to get an
	aligned address for the trampoline code.  For RAM startup,
	ram_vectors will usually be of size zero, unless MVT and copying
	are enabled for memory estimation reasons.

1999-06-14  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/slebtime.cxx (entry2): Fix a dumb fencepost prob in some
	string poking code for output without printf...

1999-04-23  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_diag.c (hal_bsp_console_write): Added a workaround for PR
	19926.

1999-04-09  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_cache.h (HAL_[DI]CACHE_IS_ENABLED): 
	Implement these macros.

1999-04-09  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/halboot.si: Use 10 wait states for access to the 86940
	on CS1; it seems to make the Reliability Difference(tm).

1999-04-08  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/slebtime.cxx: Add CYG_INIT_PRIORITY( APPLICATION ) to the
	two static thread objects so that the test works even when libc
	steals away the default constructors.  Unfortunately this also
	means switching to an assignment constructor instead of a call.

1999-04-08  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/*.ldi: Revised SECTION_* macro arguments to
	avoid padded output sections (PR 19787)

1999-04-07  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_hwio.h: New file: define accessors for 86940 via
	alternate address space 4, register names and all that... just a
	paste out of previous hal_diag.h - it was the wrong place, but
	that's how it evolved.

	* include/hal_diag.h: Include hal_hwio.h to get accessors for
	86940 et al.  Do not define them here, it was the wrong place.

	* include/hal_clock.h: 
	* include/hal_xpic.h:
	Include hal_hwio.h instead of hal_diag.h	

1999-04-07  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/slebintr.c (checkallbut): This is a more informative
	version of the test when it fails: this is still under
	investigation somewhat, and running the more verbose version
	nightly will be useful.	

1999-03-30  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/slebintr.c (start): After some thought, the timing code in
	here could cause the test to take arbitrarily long; so some safety
	features added.  Normally the test loop is very fast, but with
	cache effects and instrumentation and -O0 it could take ages; this
	could explain the occasional timeouts we have seen for this test.

1999-03-26  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_cache.h: 
	Implement the cache control macros: at least
	for x in ( D I )
	    HAL_xCACHE_ENABLE/DISABLE
	    HAL_xCACHE_INVALIDATE_ALL, HAL_xCACHE_SYNC
	in the first instance.  kcache1 reports sensible numbers too!
	
1999-03-26  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/slebintr.c (HAL_CLOCK_READ): If there is no kernel, the
	clock is not initialized, so looking at it is useless for a clue.
	So provide a dummy so we perform a "few" loops when there's no
	kernel. If there is no kernel, cyg_user_start() is never called,
	main gets in and steals the CPU.  So we hang.  So if there is no
	kernel, define cyg_start() instead to wrest control.  Also very
	much weaken the looping count check; kernel instrumentation, for
	example, is more than enough to slow the world down too much.

	* tests/slebstak.c (cyg_[user_]start):
	If there is no kernel, cyg_user_start() is never called, main gets
	in and steals the CPU.  So we hang.  So if there is no kernel,
	define cyg_start() instead to wrest control.

	* tests/slebtime.cxx: 
	Make this build when no kernel present; include of testcase &c
	was the wrong side of the ifdef.  Doh!

1999-03-25  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_priv.c (hal_clock_initialize): Oh dear, the clock was
	only running half the speed it should have; this will make the
	tm_basic figures look bad, maybe.  It _appeared_ right because of
	spurious interrupts, making two ISRs per tick, which covered the
	error beautifully.  So, the initialization is now corrected, now
	that the interrupt management is better dealt with.

	* include/hal_xpic.h (HAL_INTERRUPT_ACKNOWLEDGE): Loop until
	either the interrupt has stopped being asserted by the
	prioritization latch (CLIRL) or the source has actually re-flagged
	the interrupt, so that repeated, fast interrupts will re-interrupt
	rather than causing a loop here.  This is to prevent spurious
	double interrupts caused by HAL_INTERRUPT_ACKNOWLEDGE() not taking
	effect before the CPU re-enabled interrupts; this had been
	covering the clock bug as well as confusing the serial system.

	Also placed a HAL_INTERRUPT_ACKNOWLEDGE() in
	HAL_INTERRUPT_CONFIGURE() since the doc implies it is necessary
	when changing that stuff; a spurious interrupt may be latched.
	
1999-03-24  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_xpic.h (HAL_INTERRUPT_CONFIGURE): 
	Implement this functionality, since Gary wanted to experiment with
	it.  Also add HAL_INTERRUPT_QUERY_INFO (platform specific) to read
	back the settings of a particular interrupt source.

	* tests/slebintr.c: NEW FILE: test case for the above new macros.
	* tests/slebstak.c: NEW FILE: tests the register save/restore code
		by carrying out lots of factorial calculations.
	* tests/slebtime.c: NEW FILE: tests HAL clocks for sanity; prints
		useful diagnostics.  Most useful when a human observes, if
		it goes wrong this test is more likely to report a timeout
		than a failure.

	* tests/sleb.c: FILE DELETED - moved to slebstak.c
	
	* tests/PKGconf.mak (TESTS): Reflect above changes.

1999-03-23  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/hal_sparclite_sleb.h: Modify display string
	for consistency.

1999-03-23  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_diag.c (hal_diag_write_char): Precisely undo the
	previous change: we disable interrupts to prevent the clock
	advancing during the time taken to output to GDB.

1999-03-18  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_diag.c (hal_diag_write_char_serial): Do not disable
	interrupts while calling the CygMon write-line routine; CygMon is
	better now and can cope with interrupts there.

1999-03-17  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_sparclite_sleb_rom.mlt: Regenerate using
	the eCos configuration tool to resolve errors.

1999-03-17  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_sparclite_sleb_rom.mlt: 
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_sparclite_sleb_rom.ldi: 
	Move the start of RAM up 512 bytes; it is now at 0x04000200.  This
	is to leave space for the trampoline code ie. RAM trap vector
	handler to live in RAM as is required.  NB the vector must be on a
	4k boundary; its location is determined by rounding down the start
	of "normal" RAM ie. the symbol ".data".  So if the start of RAM
	isn't on a 4k boundary, or the trampoline code gets > 4k, there
	will be trouble.

	* include/halboot.si: Copy trampoline code into RAM base during
	startup, and deal with associated caching issues.

	* src/hal_priv.c (LED): Add this tidier macro and some extra LED
	debug during start for help with ROM start.

	* include/pkgconf/hal_sparclite_sleb.h
	(CYGHWR_HAL_SPARCLITE_SLEB_STARTUP): Add this define and its
	associated notCDL for the GUI Config tool.

1999-03-16  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_sparclite_sleb_rom.ldi:
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_sparclite_sleb_rom.mlt:
	New files, linker script fragment and MLT doc for ROM startup.
	
	* include/halboot.si: Only copy real instructions into the vector
	if RAM startup.  Delete lots of obsolete debugging "printout".
	Size RAM dynamically.  Set up chip selects, wait states, refresh
	timing, system services, caches, buffers, burst mode access, ...
	In other words complete hardware initialization.	

	* include/hal_cpu.h: new file, taken directly from CygMon sources,
	which defines various MB8683x internal registers which are used in
	the initialization in halboot.si.

	* include/hal_diag.h (HAL_SPARC_86940_PRS_ODIV2): Add lots more
	definition of the MB86940 companion I/O chip, editted from CygMon
	sources.  This should move into a proper IO file later.
	Also, in the non-CYG_KERNEL_DIAG_GDB case where we write output to
	the serial line in clear, do perform initialization.

	* src/hal_diag.c (hal_diag_init): Properly initialize the serial
	line when not using GDB encoding (if GDB coding is in use, then we
	have CygMon).

	* include/hal_clock.h (HAL_CLOCK_INITIALIZE): Initialize the clock
	more cleanly and correctly, as CygMon does: so ticks are actually
	centiSeconds, pretty much.  Actual init routine is in hal_priv.c.

	* src/hal_priv.c (hal_clock_initialize): Properly initialize the
	system clock to centiSeconds.

1999-03-11  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_priv.c (hal_board_prestart): 
	Link in the multi-thread aware debugging routine if
	CYGDBG_KERNEL_DEBUG_GDB_THREAD_SUPPORT.
	
1999-03-09  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_priv.c (hal_board_prestart): If playing nice with
	CygMon, unmask and pass through interrupt 14 (Ethernet
	controller).  Install and unmask interrupt 15 (NMI button)
	likewise.

	* src/hal_cygm.S (hal_nmi_handler): Add new handler for the NMI
	interrupt (like a PIN number) INT15, the button near the serial
	connector on the board.  The handler must wait for the interrupt
	to go away, then acknowledge it to prevent CygMon getting in a
	loop.

	* include/halboot.si: Set IRC channel 14 (Ethernet controller)
	interrupt to active low so that we can pass such events on to
	CygMon.  Tidy up comments and ifdefs.

	* include/hal_cygm.h (BSP_NOTVEC_BSP_COMM_PROCS): Define the
	CygMon vector table entry that isn't a vector, but is a pointer to
	struct tree with IO functions therein.

	* src/hal_diag.c (hal_diag_write_char et al): Add variants of
	these routines to use IO functions provided by CygMon if thus
	configured.  Also tidied up direct GDB-ized serial output, which
	is selected by CYG_KERNEL_DIAG_GDB_SERIAL_DIRECT within
	CYG_KERNEL_DIAG_GDB now.

	* include/pkgconf/hal_sparclite_sleb.h: Add definition for
	CYG_KERNEL_DIAG_GDB_SERIAL_DIRECT, disabled by default.  More
	comments too.

1999-03-04  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/*.ldi: give all LDI files unique names so
        that they can co-exist in an eCos build tree (PR 19184)
	* include/pkgconf/*.mlt: give all MLT files unique names so
        that they can co-exist in an eCos build tree (PR 19184)

1999-02-25  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	These log entries from 1999-02-22 to 1999-02-24 were executed in
	a branch; this change is a merge of that branch into the trunk.

1999-02-25  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@masala.cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_diag.c (hal_diag_write_char): 
	Wait for the GDB protocol ack character '+' after sending a line
	of output as a $O packet; this prevents mismatches of the GDB
	protocol when a breakpoint is hit temporally near such output.
	This has the side effect that we must deal with seeing a ^C
	character instead of the '+', whence we must bounce into CygMon's
	BREAK vector using a trap.  Hence the next change...

	* src/hal_cygm.S (hal_user_trap_to_cygmon_vsr): 
	Add additional "bounce to cygmon" capability such that user trap
	2, "ta 2" trap type 130, does the same as "ta 1" ie. a breakpoint,
	but first it advances the PC and NPC so that you can continue at
	the instruction after.  This is so that a voluntary inline
	breakpoint can be implemented as "ta 2; nop; nop; nop" (nops just
	for paranoia).

1999-02-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_diag.h: 
	Make hal_diag_init() and hal_diag_write_char() prototypes be extern "C"
	for C++ files so they don't get name mangled

1999-02-24  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/hal_sparclite_sleb.h: Add MB8683x board
	designation to description field.

1999-02-24  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/hal_sparclite_sleb.h: 
	Non-CDLoptions, but #defines nontheless,
	CYG_HAL_USE_ROM_MONITOR_CYGMON and CYG_KERNEL_DIAG_GDB are defined
	here to control whether we cooperate with CygMon, and if so, do we
	encapsulate out output in GDB $O packets, respectively.

	* include/hal_cygm.h: 
	New file to describe the CygMon vectors we call to cooperate with
	CygMon and GDB.  When cooperating, we install VSRs in some slots
	that demux into CygMon's vector table, and in most slots we just
	patch in the appropriate value from CygMon's vector table so that
	CygMon is called directly.

	* include/hal_xpic.h: 
	Document the interrupt sources on the SLEB.

	* include/hal_diag.h (HAL_DIAG_WRITE_CHAR): 
	Call routines in hal_diag.c to perform encapsulation, or not,
	depending on CYG_KERNEL_DIAG_GDB.

	* src/hal_cygm.S: New file, demuxer trampolines for user trap and
	no-fp/no-cp VSRs to bounce into CygMon.
	
	* src/hal_diag.c: New file, routines to perform encapsulation of
	output in GDB $O packets if required by CYG_KERNEL_DIAG.
	
	* src/hal_priv.c (hal_board_prestart):
	If CYG_HAL_USE_ROM_MONITOR_CYGMON, install either CygMon's vectors
	or demuxer trampolines into our VSRs during startup.

	* src/PKGconf.mak (COMPILE): Add new files hal_cygm.S hal_diag.c

1999-02-23  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/hal_sparclite_sleb.h: Revise capitalization
	of CDL strings.

1999-02-23  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/hal_sparclite_sleb.h: Specify correct platform
	for cdl_package CYGPKG_HAL_SPARCLITE_SLEB.

1999-02-22  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/ram.mlt: 
	* include/pkgconf/ram.ldi: 
	All a lot more constraints on alignment: sections must be
	word-aligned at least for the network loader to accept them.
	I hope I have correctly modified the .mlt file; it's not exactly
	self documenting.

1999-02-22  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_cache.h: New file
	* include/hal_clock.h: New file
	* include/hal_diag.h: New file

	* src/hal_priv.c: New file
	* tests/PKGconf.mak: New file
	* tests/sleb.c: New file

	Initial checkin of the hardware platform port for SPARClite:
	platform is sleb: SPARClite Evaluation Board.

	The structure here mirrors that in the sim directory, and in fact
	was cloned from it after the change of 1999-02-08 for MLT
	compliance.
