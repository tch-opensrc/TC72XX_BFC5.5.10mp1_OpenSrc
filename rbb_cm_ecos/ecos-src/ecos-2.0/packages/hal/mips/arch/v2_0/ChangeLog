2003-02-27  Nick Garnett  <nickg@calivar.com>

	* include/mips-stub.h: Disabled option that makes MIPS32 targets
	use 64 bit registers in GDB protocol. The standard GDB does not
	support this, only MIPS own version.

2003-01-31  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_syscall.c (hal_syscall_handler): Let generic syscall code
	handle exit.

2003-01-09  Tim Michals  <t.michals@attbi.com>

	* src/hal_misc.c (hal_delay_us): Use HAL_CLOCK_READ instead of inline
	asm, to allow for variant/platform HAL packages overriding.

2002-12-12  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* include/hal_cache.h: allow for cache flushes etc. where the base
	address is not aligned to a cacheline boundary.

2002-08-02  Andrew Lunn <Andrew.Lunn@ascom.ch>

	* cdl/hal_mips.cdl: Redboot exec command can now be disabled 
	  by CDL
	
2002-05-17  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_intr.h: Fix CYGNUM_HAL_EXCEPTION_MIN definition so
	it reflects the FPU configuration.

2002-04-30  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_intr.h: Only define decoded FPU vectors if these are
	actually used. This allows tests to check for capabilities and do
	N/A when appropriate.

2002-04-15  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_syscall.c (hal_syscall_handler): Add extra sig argument to
	__do_syscall.

2002-03-21  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_cache.h: Added macros to adjust the size argument to
	some of the cache macros to a whole multiple of the cache line
	size. Otherwise, for some values of the arguments, we can miss the
	last line.

2001-12-17  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_arch.h (CYGARC_HAL_GET_RETURN_ADDRESS,
	(CYGARC_HAL_GET_RETURN_ADDRESS_BACKUP): Added dummy arguments.

	* src/hal_misc.c (cyg_hal_exception_handler): Fix warning.

2001-12-04  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_misc.c: Added hal_arch_program_new_stack() to support
	running user programs on a new stack placed at the top of RAM.

	* src/vectors.S: Added hal_program_new_stack function to support
	hal_arch_program_new_stack(). This does the actual stack
	switching.

	* include/mips-stub.h (NUMREGS): 
	* include/mips-regs.h (NUM_REGS):
	Added test to correctly define these when the target expects the
	CP0 registers to be reported to GDB

	* include/hal_arch.h: Added support for fetching CP0 registers in
	MIPS64 platforms for GDB. Reorganized the code slightly.

	* cdl/hal_mips.cdl:
	Added define_proc to define HAL_ARCH_PROGRAM_NEW_STACK.

2001-11-16  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_misc.c (hal_msbit_index): Fixed this function so that it
	actually works!

2001-10-24  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S:
	Change behaviour of __default_exception_vsr to only switch to
	interrupt stack if we are not already on it. This is now similar
	to the way the interrupt VSR operates. This is necessary since it
	is possible to take exceptions (such as TLB miss or address error)
	while running in the GDB stubs.

	* src/hal_misc.c (cyg_hal_exception_handler): Ensure that PC
	planted when catching stub exceptions gets sign extended where
	necessary in 64 bit platforms.

2001-10-05  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_arch.h: Provide CYGARC_CACHED_ADDRESS() and friends
	without casting for use in assembler files.

2001-09-17  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_misc.c (hal_delay_us): Rewrote this routine to work
	correctly in higher speed CPUs. The counter register counts at
	half CPU clock speed. The original ticks calculation could
	overflow very easily. For example in a 133MHz CPU, it overflowed
	with any argument greater than 32! This is another of those "how
	did it ever work?" things.

	* include/hal_arch.h: Added casts to CYGARC_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS() and
	friends.

2001-09-07  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* include/mips-stub.h: Returned target_register_t to long long
	type for VR4300 target. This is the only platform that does 64bit
	register saves/restores, and the GDB registers must be full sized.

	* include/arch.inc: Added option to select correct initial SR
	value when the startup is ROMRAM.
	Disabled setting of status and config registers when using a ROM
	monitor. The monitor should have already set these to appropriate
	values.

2001-08-22  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/redboot_linux_exec.c: 
	printf() is no longer a part of RedBoot.  Thus all programs
	must use diag_printf() and related functions instead.

2001-08-01  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S (restore_state): (see the change below 2001-07-03)
	Make the code to keep SR IM bits from the ISR conditional on a CDL
	interface so that it is selected on a per-platform or variant basis.

	* cdl/hal_mips.cdl (CYGINT_HAL_MIPS_INTERRUPT_RETURN_KEEP_SR_IM):
	New interface to control conditional code.

	* include/hal_intr.h (HAL_ENABLE_INTERRUPTS): Make this (et al)
	conditional on CYGHWR_HAL_INTERRUPT_ENABLE_DISABLE_RESTORE_DEFINED
	so that the variant HAL can define these insead, in the usual
	manner.

2001-07-20  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/redboot_linux_exec.c: Adjust below change by getting baud
	rate, thus allowing for runtime baud rate changes, and no
	dependency on platform CDL defines.

2001-07-19  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/redboot_linux_exec.c: Define DEFAULT_BAUD.  The supporting
	CDL differs from platform to platform, so this define is used to
	ameliorate the differences.

2001-07-17  David Woodhouse <dwmw2@redhat.com>

	* src/redboot_linux_exec.c: Add environment stuff to the 'exec' 
	command, also make it use the entry point from the last 'load' 
	command if there is one.
	Also add '-w' delay option.

2001-07-09  David Woodhouse <dwmw2@redhat.com>

	* src/redboot_linux_exec.c: New 'exec' command for RedBoot, mostly
	copied from the SH version, hacked to pass arguments in argc/argv
	form as that seems to be what most Linux/MIPS kernels expect to
	receive from PMON.
	* cdl/hal_mips.cdl: Add necessary magic for the above.
	
2001-07-03  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S (restore_state): When restoring the CPU status
	register right at the end of interrupt processing, keep the
	current settings of the IM[7:0] bits within the status register.
	Depending on platform, these may be used as interrupt masks, so if
	an ISR or DSR masks interrupts they must be preserved.  If they
	are not used, then this does no harm.
	#ifdef'd out for CYG_HAL_MIPS_R3900 anyway 'cos the TX39 does not
	use these bits at all.

2001-06-27  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S (_start): Add code to switch from KSEG1 to KSEG0 if
	CYGARC_START_FUNC_UNCACHED.

2001-06-27  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_misc.c: Include <cyg/hal/hal_if.h> for definition of
	hal_ctrlc_isr() and hence warnings reduced.

2001-06-19  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_arch.h: Support saving/restoring CP0 registers for GDB.

	* include/mips-stub.h (NUMREGS): Use different value for mips32.

2001-06-08  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/mips.inc (FUNC_START): Added .noreorder.

2001-06-05  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* include/mips-stub.h: Configuration messing to avoid the need to
	add a platform-specific clause for every new 32-as-64-to-GDB
	target that we make.  The header can now pick REGSIZE,
	target_register_t and so on according to a generic define as well
	as specific platform defs.

	* cdl/hal_mips.cdl: Provide interface for the above, so targets
	can implement it.  CYGINT_HAL_MIPS_STUB_REPRESENT_32BIT_AS_64BIT

2001-02-27  Chris Morrow  <cmorrow@YottaYotta.com>

	* src/vectors.S (hal_zero_bss): Oops, allow for bss being multiple
	of block size. And add delay slot.

2001-02-26  Chris Morrow  <cmorrow@YottaYotta.com>

	* src/vectors.S (hal_zero_bss): Implemented in assembler for speed.
	* src/hal_misc.c (hal_zero_bss): Delete.

2001-02-15  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_misc.c: Added option to call hal_ctrlc_isr() in default
	ISR when in RedBoot.

2001-02-12  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/mips.inc: Added some extra CP0 register names.

2001-02-09  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S: Small tweak of comments to work around tools problem
	with mipsisa32 tools.

2001-01-31  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/mips-stub.h: Added prototypes for __is_bsp_syscall() and
	hal_syscall_handler().

	* include/hal_arch.h:
	Reorganized HAL_SavedRegisters structure to work properly with a
	64 bit processor. Fields are now correctly sized, and aligned on
	the right boundaries.

	* include/arch.inc:
	Added option for variant and platform to supply extra bits to be
	added to INITIAL_SR.
	Reorganized register save area layout to match changes in
	hal_arch.h.
	Added macros sva, lva, mvatc0, mvafc0 to transfer 64 bit items to
	and from memory/CP0 (*va* is used because most such values are
	(virtual) addresses).

	* src/vectors.S: Added use of *va* macros where appropriate.
	
	* src/mips-stub.c: Added __is_bsp_syscall() function.

	* src/hal_syscall.c: Added this file to support GNUPro system
	calls in RedBoot.

	* cdl/hal_mips.cdl: Added hal_syscall.c to compile list.

2001-01-26  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_intr.h: Added extern for hal_delay_us.

2001-01-26  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/variant.inc: Make hal_intc_decode macro mask the cause
	register with the status (interrupt mask) register.

2001-01-25  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/arch.inc: Allow hal_intc_decode to be defined by variant
	or platform.

2000-12-06  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_intr.h (HAL_DELAY_US): Added.
	* src/hal_misc.c (hal_delay_us): Added. And fixed to work with an
	incrementer that ticks at the pipeline clock rate.

	* include/mips-stub.h: RM7000 is also a 64bit CPU.

2000-12-05  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_cache.h: IWAY->_IWAY, DWAY->_DWAY for namespace 
	cleanliness

2000-12-05  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_cache.h: Use variant specific method to select cache
	WAY.

2000-10-20  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_misc.c: Update __mem_fault_handler declaration.

2000-09-15  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_intr.h (HAL_DEFAULT_ISR): Fix warning.
	(HAL_DEFAULT_ISR): Undo that change.

2000-09-14  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_intr.h: Only define _FPE when there's a FPU.

2000-09-13  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_intr.h (HAL_VSR_SET_TO_ECOS_HANDLER): Fix compiler
	warning.

	* src/vectors.S: Fully decode TLB related exceptions.
	* src/hal_misc.c (cyg_hal_exception_handler): Undid below change.

	* src/hal_misc.c (cyg_hal_exception_handler): Base vector
	calculation on cause register, not the provided vector value.

2000-09-12  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_intr.h: Added definition for decoded FPU
	exceptions.

	* src/hal_misc.c (cyg_hal_exception_handler): Decode FPU
	exceptions.

2000-09-07  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/basetype.h: Removed change from yesterday.

	* include/hal_intr.h (CYGNUM_HAL_EXCEPTION_FPU): Associated to FPE
	exceptions.

2000-09-06  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/basetype.h: Override the alignment macros for the MIPS
	architecture. The MIPS compiler only alows a maximum of 4 bytes
	of alignment where as the default is 8

	* include/hal_cache.h (_HAL_ASM_DCACHE_ALL_WAYS): Force d-cache
	selection.

2000-09-01  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/mips-stub.h: No longer need to define
	CYGARC_REGSIZE_DIFFERS_FROM_TARGET_REGISTER_T
	(CYGARC_SIGN_EXTEND_REGISTERS): 

        * include/mips-stub.h: Change vr4300 register sizes to use 32-bit
        target_register_t, and tell the generic stub to use sign extension.
 	Ditto for tx49
	* include/hal_cache.h (_HAL_ASM_SET_MIPS_ISA): Don't use pasting
	when it doesn't result in a preprocessing token. Just use string
	concatenation.

2000-07-21  Drew Moseley  <dmoseley@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S: Only jump uncached to _start if
	CYGARC_START_FUNC_UNCACHED is defined.

2000-07-20  Drew Moseley  <dmoseley@redhat.com>

	* include/mips-stub.h: Define CYGARC_REGSIZE_DIFFERS_FROM_TARGET_REGISTER_T
	for the MIPS32 targets since GDB needs 64 bit registers regardless of
	what size we are really storing.

2000-07-19  Drew Moseley  <dmoseley@redhat.com>

	* include/mips-stub.h (CYGARC_SIGN_EXTEND_REGISTERS): Make sure
	the stub sign-extends the registers before returning them to GDB.

2000-07-14  Drew Moseley  <dmoseley@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S: Added hal_reset_vector_first_code and
	hal_early_init macros.

	* src/mips-stub.c (__install_breakpoints): Also install any
	breakpoints in the list.

	* include/mips-regs.h: Added a few new register definitions.

	* include/hal_intr.h: Added CYGNUM_HAL_EXCEPTION_INTERRUPT.

	* include/hal_arch.h: Added some macros for jumping between cached
	and uncached.

	* include/mips-stub.h: Renamed some enums to work around namespace
	corruption.  Added breakpoint support in the HAL.

2000-07-14  Drew Moseley  <dmoseley@redhat.com>

	* include/arch.inc: Support for mips3264.
	* include/mips-stub.h: Ditto.

2000-06-21  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/mips-stub.c: Removed use of CYG_LABEL_NAME() and added
	underscore to _breakinst.

	* include/basetype.h: Removed definition of CYG_LABEL_NAME().

2000-06-08  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_misc.c (hal_arch_default_isr): Removed what's now a
	generic C-c check in the common HAL.

	* include/hal_arch.h (CYGARC_HAL_GET_RETURN_ADDRESS): Defined.

2000-06-08  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_arch.h (CYGARC_HAL_SAVE_GP, CYGARC_HAL_RESTORE_GP):
	Added.

2000-05-25  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/basetype.h: 
	* src/mipsfp.c: 
	Support FPU double-LE layout in BE mode.

2000-05-24  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/mipsfp.c: Also handle doubles in 32bit FPU mode.

2000-05-23  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/arch.inc: 
	* src/vectors.S:
	Made exception return safe.

2000-05-22  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S: Call CTRLC init after stub initialization.

	* cdl/hal_mips.cdl: Only include CTRLC support if not prevented
	by platform.

	* include/hal_cache.h: When using 'cache' instruction, hit all
	ways, not only way0.

2000-05-18  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_io.h: Allow platforms to override IO macro
	definitions.

2000-05-16  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_intr.h:
	* src/vectors.S:
	Filter 'break 0x7' (GCC division-by-zero) exceptions out into a
	new vector.
	Fix typo.
	
2000-05-15  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/vectors.S: Allow warm-start to be treated like cold-start if
	platform requires it.

2000-05-11  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/mips-stub.h: Added register size for TX49.

2000-05-10  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/arch.inc: Force assembler into MIPS3 mode before using
	eret.

	* include/basetype.h: Fix comments.

2000-03-20  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/mips-stub.h: Make C++ safe

	* include/hal_cache.h (_hal_asm_mips_cpp_stringize): Add as a separate
	macro because the compiler has got more picky

2000-03-16  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S (_start): Set return address to 0 and unconditionally
	jump to cyg_start, so that GDB doesn't get confused with backtraces

2000-03-13  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/context.S :
	Added jmpbuf_regsize to insulate jumb buffer from changes in
	mips_regsize. This will need extra work if we go to a full 64 bit
	variant, but for now is the simplest solution to this problem.

2000-02-25  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/arch.inc: Add lpc and spc macros to save and restore PC
	* src/context.S (hal_thread_switch_context): Restore RA into PC
	location in context so that thread debugging works

2000-02-23  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/hal_misc.c (hal_idle_thread_action):
	CYG_HAL_MIPS_SIM -> CYGPKG_HAL_MIPS_SIM
	CYG_HAL_MIPS_JMR3904 -> CYGPKG_HAL_MIPS_TX39_JMR3904

	* include/arch.inc: CYG_HAL_MIPS_SIM -> CYGPKG_HAL_MIPS_SIM

2000-02-16  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_mips.cdl: removed fix me.

2000-01-14  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_arch.h: 
	* include/arch.inc: 
	* src/vectors.S: 
	* src/context.S: 
	Several fixes to allow the GPRs to be saved
	and restored as 64 bit values on some architectures. This is not
	full 64 bit support since it only covers the GPRs, HI and LO,
	there is more to be done in the CP0 registers (however it is a
	start).

1999-12-21  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S (__default_exception_vsr): Rename
	CYG_HAL_USE_ROM_MONITOR_CYGMON -> CYGSEM_HAL_USE_ROM_MONITOR_CygMon
	Rename CYG_HAL_ROM_MONITOR -> CYGSEM_HAL_ROM_MONITOR

	* src/hal_misc.c (hal_default_isr): Rename
	CYG_HAL_USE_ROM_MONITOR_CYGMON ->
	CYGSEM_HAL_USE_ROM_MONITOR_CygMon

	* include/arch.inc: Rename CYG_HAL_USE_ROM_MONITOR ->
	CYGSEM_HAL_USE_ROM_MONITOR

1999-12-20  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_mips.cdl:

	Fix syntax error.

1999-12-17  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/mipsfp.c (flt2reg): New inline function to convert between
	float union and register type
	(reg2flt): Likewise in reverse
	(cyg_hal_mips_process_fpe): Handle endianness correctly using the above
	functions. Avoid possible aliasing problems with the compiler. Ensure
	values are zeroed with the correct sign. Check for denormalized operands
	for all remaining FPU opcodes.

	* src/hal_misc.c (cyg_hal_exception_handler): Allow handling of
	unimplemented operation FPU exceptions to be configurable
	* include/pkgconf/hal_mips.h: Provide
	CYGSEM_HAL_MIPS_EMULATE_UNIMPLEMENTED_FPU_OPS to do this
	* cdl/hal_mips.cdl: Likewise

	All the above required for cases 102817 and 102820

1999-12-15  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_intr.h (CYGNUM_HAL_EXCEPTION_COUNT): Ensure you can
	handle FPU exceptions if present
	Reported in case 102817

1999-12-02  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_mips.cdl:

	Use the <PACKAGE> token in custom rules.

1999-12-01  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_mips.cdl:

	Use the <PREFIX> token in custom rules.

1999-11-04  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_mips.cdl:

	Output custom rule dependency information to .deps files in
	the current directory.

	Dispense with the need to create a 'src' sub-directory.

1999-11-04  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S: Added code in reset vector to reset the config0
	register to a known state. This is because on some MIPS variants
	the K0 field comes up in an undefined state.
	[Later] Moved this code to just work in the case of a cold boot.
	NMIs and warm boots should leave it as it was.

1999-11-02  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_mips.cdl: Added.

1999-10-29  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/hal_mips.h: Added condition to set a
	MIPS-private option (CYGDBG_HAL_MIPS_DEBUG_GDB_CTRLC_SUPPORT) if
	either CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_CTRLC_SUPPORT or
	CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_BREAK_SUPPORT are defined. In the MIPS HAL
	these are implmented with the same code.

	* src/hal_misc.c: Changed CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_CTRLC_SUPPORT to
	CYGDBG_HAL_MIPS_DEBUG_GDB_CTRLC_SUPPORT.

	* src/vectors.S: Space for old SP after switching to interrupt
	stack must be 8 bytes to preserve alignment of SP. Otherwise any
	nested interrupts or exceptions will get an address error
	exception if the FP regs are saved, which then recurses.
	Changed CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_CTRLC_SUPPORT to
	CYGDBG_HAL_MIPS_DEBUG_GDB_CTRLC_SUPPORT.
	
	* src/mips-stub.c (__is_breakpoint_function): Fixed comparison
	between PC register and label. On 64 bit CPUs these are both 32
	bit values in 64 bit types, but the way that they are generated,
	the PC is zero extended and the label is sign extended. This
	caused them to always differ. Fixed by casting label to unsigned
	long before widening.

1999-10-22  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S: Replaced ifdef with call to hal_intc_translate
	macro so the behaviour here may be customized by variant or
	platform HALs.

	* include/arch.inc: Added default implementations of
	hal_intc_translate macro.

1999-10-05  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/basetype.h: Made definition of CYG_BYTEORDER dependent
	on definition of CYGPKG_HAL_MIPS_[L|M]SBFIRST.

1999-09-17  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S (__default_exception_vsr):
	Rename exception_handler()->cyg_hal_exception_handler()
	After all, we will just do a jump rather than a jal into
	cyg_hal_exception_handler()
	(restore_state): Make the change below (by Hugo) be conditional
	on CYG_HAL_USE_ROM_MONITOR_CYGMON.
	Add explanatory comment about the additions for Cygmon

	* src/hal_misc.c (hal_default_isr): Use new format HAL_DIAG_IRQ_CHECK()
	and check return code is negative; if so, return
	(cyg_hal_exception_handler): Rename from exception_handler()
	Now return cyg_uint32, but default to returning 0 always

1999-09-16  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	This set of changes with matching ones in jmr3904 comes from Mark
	Salter's work to make jmr3904 CygMon talk Ethernet.
	
	* src/vectors.S (restore_state): Call CygMon for exceptions or
	unhandled interrupts if CYG_HAL_USE_ROM_MONITOR.  This is why the
	return value from the ISR is preserved.  Don't fully understand
	this.

	* src/hal_misc.c (hal_default_isr): Call into hal_diag via
	HAL_DIAG_IRQ_CHECK if it's defined and CYG_HAL_USE_ROM_MONITOR.
	This lets CygMon check for network interrupts &c.

1999-09-09  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/arch.inc (hal_fpu_save_caller): Save fcr31 first as
	recommended by user's manual
	(hal_fpu_load_caller): Similarly restore fcr31 last

	Rename CYG_HAL_MIPS_FSR_INIT to CYG_HAL_MIPS_FCSR_INIT since that's
	closer to its documented name

	* include/mips-regs.h: 
	Add floating point register definitions, and bitfields/masks for FCR31
	in particular

	* src/mips-stub.c (__single_step):
	Enable FP branch support if the hardware has an FPU.

	Change register access to FCR using HAL macro names from mips-regs.h

	When comparing branch tests with 0, cast the result of get_register()
	to int so that it works on 64-bit MIPS targets even in 32-bit mode,
	when GDB still insists REG_SIZE must be 8 (in which case negative
	results would otherwise go positive)
	
	* src/mipsfp.c: New file to emulate unimplemented MIPS FP operations
	* src/PKGconf.mak (COMPILE): compile it

	* src/hal_misc.c (exception_handler): If we have an FPU and get an FP
	exception, call cyg_hal_mips_process_fpe() from mipsfp.c to process
	it

1999-05-21  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_intr.h: Define HAL_INTERRUPT_STACK_BASE and
	HAL_INTERRUPT_STACK_TOP so that stack usage macros in
	kernel/.../stackmon.hxx can work.

	* src/vectors.S (cyg_interrupt_stack_base): Define this symbol for

1999-05-13  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>
	The following have been merged from a branch:
	
    1999-05-11  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_arch.h: 
	* include/hal_intr.h: 
	* include/hal_cache.h: 
	* include/arch.inc:
	Changed references to "imp" and "implementation" to "var" and
	"variant" respectively. These are better names for these files and
	functions.

	* src/vectors.S: 
	Removed or disabled some development/debug code.
	Same imp->var changes as above.
	
    1999-05-06  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S: Added call to hal_cpu_except_enable in
	__default_exception_vsr to re-enable nested exceptions.

	* src/mips-stub.c: Use _registers[X] rather that register[X] for
	accessing CPU registers, since the former may point to per-thread
	register sets while the latter only refers to the current trap
	register set.

	* include/arch.inc: Added hal_cpu_except_enable macro to
	(re-)enable exception processing and disable interrupts. This is
	necessary if we are to allow nested exceptions (like breakpoints
	in exception handlers).

    1999-04-29  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S: Reenable interrupts while processing exceptions.
	Several temporary kludges to permit us to test ROM code from RAM
	under PMON.

	* include/mips.inc: Extended list of CP0 register aliases.

	* include/mips-stub.h: The stubs must behave as if we are on a 64
	bit processor when debugging the VR4300, since that is what GDB
	expects.
	
	* include/arch.inc: Added generic version of hal_cache_init to
	disable kseg0 caching in config0 register.

	* include/hal_cache.h: Moved dummy addresses used in index
	operations to 0x80000000, zero caused MMU exceptions.
	Fixed looping bugs in all macros that use them.

    1999-04-28  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	[v1_2_2_beta branch]
	* src/vectors.S: Add dummy "__gccmain()"

    1999-04-27  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	and restore. Started some preparations for 64 bit processor
	support.

	* include/mips.inc: Added floating point register aliases. Moved
	saved state to arch.inc.

	* include/hal_arch.h: Completed support for floating point state
	save and restore. Parameterized GDB support macros a little to
	enable GDB to work properly.

	* include/arch.inc: Added support for floating point state save
	and restore. Moved assembler version of saved state layout here
	from mips.inc.

    1999-04-22  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/context.S (hal_thread_load_context): Substituted explicit
	code to reload the interrupt enable state with a macro.

	* include/hal_cache.h: Removed default implementations of
	HAL_[D/I]CACHE_[EN/DIS]ABLE since these were actually TX39
	specific. There is aparrently no standard way of implementing
	these function in the MIPS architecture.

	* include/mips.inc: Added a comment to point out a TX39-only
	register.
	
	* src/vectors.S: Modified hal_interrupt_stack_call_pending_DSRs()
	to also call DSRs with interrupts enabled. Returns interrupt state
	to original value when finished.
	Use hal_cpu_int_ensable macro in place of explicit code in
	hal_interrupt_stack_call_pending_DSRs().

    1999-04-21  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/arch.inc: Ifdeffed definition of hal_intc_init macro to
	allow it to be defined elsewhere. Added default versions of diag
	macros.

	* src/vectors.S: Added some low-level diagnostic macros to show
	HAL events if there is adequate hardware (such as leds).
	Removed interrupt enable/disables in interrupt processing since we
	can now go through a thread switch with interrupts disabled.
	Ifdeffed ISR tables so they can be defined elsewhere.
	Added implementation of hal_interrupt_stack_call_pending_DSRs.
	Added calls to implementation and platform init routines.
	
	* src/hal_misc.c: Many changes to hal_idle_thread_action() to
	print or instrument various CPU registers. Left with code to
	wiggle an led in the idle loop.
	Stripped out TX39 specific code and moved it to plf_misc.c.
	
	* src/context.S: Added code to save and restore the interrupt mask
	state in thread contexts.

	* include/hal_intr.h:
	Renamed default interrupts to match the hardware more closely.
	Added ifdef around HAL_TRANSLATE_VECTOR() so it can be made
	platform/variant specific. Added implementation of
	HAL_INTERRUPT_ACKNOWLEDGE().

	* include/hal_arch.h (HAL_THREAD_INIT_CONTEXT): Aligned the
	intitial stack pointer to 16 byte boundary, added an initial value
	for the status register.

	* include/arch.inc: Added some nops to eret macros.

    1999-04-13  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_misc.c: Added vector decoding to the below.
    1999-04-30  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@masala.cygnus.co.uk>
	* src/hal_misc.c (hal_init_ctrlc_intr): Chain onto the old value
	of the ISR when attaching the ctrl-c ISR; this allows chained
	interrupts to work (otherwise a stack-wrecking interrupt loop
	occurs).
    1999-04-29  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>
	* include/pkgconf/hal_tx39.h (CYGDBG_HAL_MIPS_INSTALL_CTRL_C_ISR): 
	New config option, on by default.
	* src/hal_misc.c (hal_ctrlc_isr): Enable these features on

1999-04-28  Bart Veer  <bartv@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/PKGconf.mak:
	Remove the -n argument to tail, it does not appear to be required
	on any supported host and causes problems with some
	implementations of tail.

1999-04-20  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_intr.h: Don't sync TRR if platform sim - it doesn't need

	* include/pkgconf/hal_tx39.h: 
	Allow CYGARC_TX39_PR19846 to override

	cyg_hal_invoke_constructors() can be called again safely if
	necessary
	Related fix to that of PR19642

1999-04-14  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	Also moved address used in HAL_DCACHE_INVALIDATE_ALL() to
	0x9fc00000, which is the cached ROM space.

1999-03-24  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S:
	Added options to allow different settings for DRAM initialization.
	Fixed some ifdef bugs.

1999-03-17  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_misc.c (cyg_hal_user_break): Remove #warning - it doesn't
	really provide any useful info, and may unnecessarily worry a user
	since it fires in normal situations

	Disabled use of stand-alone ^C detection interrupt. This is now
	done in the serial driver. Added cyg_hal_is_break() and
	cyg_hal_user_break() to detect and provoke ^C processing. These
	are used by the serial driver and will one day interact with the
	BSP/Cygmon/GDB stubs to do the right thing.

1999-03-10  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/vectors.S:
	Added support for 66MHz part (untested).
	Added support for SIGINT-causing magic breakpoint to allow
	continuation after ^C. This also relies on CYGMON changes.

	* include/hal_cache.h:
	Moved nested external declarations into top-level scope to avoid
	compiler warnings.

1999-02-02  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_cache.h :
	In HAL_ICACHE_INVALIDATE_ALL() and HAL_ICACHE_INVALIDATE(), fixed
	typos in passing arguments to asm sections.
	Fixes PR 18951.

1999-01-26  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@masala.cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/mips.ld:
	Add copyright notice.  (Though these files will later be generated
	by a tool and so not copyright, these default setups are.)

1999-01-21  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_misc.c (cyg_hal_invoke_constructors): 
	Add code to deal with CYGSEM_HAL_STOP_CONSTRUCTORS_ON_FLAG
	Tidy up and update description header
	Shorten needlessly long lines
	Remove all traces of non-CYG_KERNEL_USE_INIT_PRIORITY code

1999-01-15  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/mips.ld:
	Provide alternate definition of macro SECTION_rom_vectors() for
	RAM startup (CYG_HAL_STARTUP_RAM) so that minimal sim testing
	works.  Note: this is an instance where two definitions (of
	identical "API") of a macro occur in the prototype <target>.ld
	file; the MLT is required not to be confused by this.

1999-01-15  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	for words within doubles.

1999-01-12  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_cache.h: 
	Modified HAL_DCACHE_INVALIDATE_ALL() to correctly touch all cache
	lines twice to ensure that the cache and memory are
	consistent. This is the best we can do without direct support for
	invalidation.
	
	* src/hal_misc.c: Altered call to patch_dbg_syscalls() to pass
	pointer to base of vector rather than a single vector entry.
