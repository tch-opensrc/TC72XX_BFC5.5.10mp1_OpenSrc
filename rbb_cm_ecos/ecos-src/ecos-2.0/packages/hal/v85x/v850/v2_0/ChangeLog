	* src/v85x_v850.ld:
	Added .eh_frame to data section. This is a stopgap fix to allow
	C++ programs that define exceptions to link and run. It does not
	allow them to actually throw exceptions, since that depends on
	compiler changes that have not been made. Further, more
	far-reaching, linker script changes will also be needs when that
	happens.	
	Added libsupc++.a to GROUP() directive for GCC versions later than
	3.0.

2002-05-23  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_v85x_v850.cdl: Don't run cache tests.

2001-06-21  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/v850_common.h: Add register defns for other V850/SA1 models.

2001-04-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_v85x_v850.cdl: Separate v850_ice.cxx into separate file
	and only build if CYGDBG_HAL_V850_ICE. Also only build for ROM
	or ROMRAM startup.
	* src/hal_diag.c: msec_timeout can be static
	* src/v850_stub.c: Separate ICE support into new v850_ice.cxx file from
	here
	* src/v850_ice.cxx: New file
	* src/v85x_v850.ld: Enter at reset_vector for ROM or ROMRAM startup.
	This is better when loading via ICE.

2001-03-29  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_v85x_v850.cdl: Fix typo.

2001-03-28  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_diag.c: Move here from platform HALs - on-board serial0
	is generic for V850 platforms.

	* cdl/hal_v85x_v850.cdl: Build hal_diag.c
	Add interfaces indicating variant.
	Add option for ICE debugging.

	* include/v850_common.h: Move register definitions here from
	platform HAL and define both SA1 and SB1 variants.
	Also rename some to match official docs.

	* include/var_arch.h: No need to include <pkgconf/hal.h>

	* include/var_cache.h: Provide empty default cache macros here.

	* include/var_intr.h: Move interrupt definitions here from
	platform HAL and define for both SA1 and SB1 variants.
	Also rename some to match official docs.

	* src/v850_misc.c: Doesn't use tracing, so don't include header.

	* src/v850_stub.c: Reflect CYGNUM_HAL_VECTOR_WATCHDOG_TIMER ->
	CYGNUM_HAL_VECTOR_INTWDT renaming.
	Add support for debugging via ICE and gdbserv.

	* src/v85x_v850.ld: Start at "start" not "reset_vector".
	Support ram_vectors section (separated out to support ROMRAM startup).

	* src/nec.ld: Remove - redundant.

	* tests/nmitest.c: Added. Standalone test for checking if we've
	received an NMI.

2000-09-06  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_v85x_v850.cdl: Improve [CPU] variant support.

2000-07-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/v850_stub.c (__is_breakpoint_function): Removed use
	of CYG_LABEL_NAME() and added underscore to _breakinst.

	* src/nec.ld, src/v85x_v850.ld:
	Switched to new table definition mechanism.

2000-06-12  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/v850_misc.c (hal_interrupt_unmask): Remove [extra]
	debug message.

2000-06-09  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/v850_misc.c: Make interrupt handling routines safe.
	Also add asserts to verify.

2000-05-25  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/v85x_v850.ld: Add platform specifics.  In particular the
	special, hardwired symbol "hal_vsr_table" needs to be platform
	specific.

2000-05-24  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/v850_common.h: Split into platform specific files.

2000-04-25  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/v85x_v850.ld: Fix linking problem with "_etext".

2000-04-14  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/v850_stub.c: Use 'br *' with a watchdog to emulate a
	breakpoint since the hardware does not support them directly.

2000-04-11  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/v850_stub.c (next_pc): Instruction "jmp [Rn]" was being
	decoded incorrectly, leading to erroneous single step behaviour.

2000-03-31  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/context.S: Use SLD/SST for smaller, faster code in context
	save/restore functions.

2000-03-30  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/context.S (_hal_longjmp): 
	(_hal_setjmp): Need to save R1/R2/R4/R5 since GCC seems to use them.

2000-03-27  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/var_intr.h: Remove extra junk left over from cut&paste.

	* src/context.S: Add setjmp/longjmp support.

2000-03-21  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/v850_stub.c (__skipinst): Use single step code properly.

2000-03-20  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/v850_stub.c: Add single step support.
