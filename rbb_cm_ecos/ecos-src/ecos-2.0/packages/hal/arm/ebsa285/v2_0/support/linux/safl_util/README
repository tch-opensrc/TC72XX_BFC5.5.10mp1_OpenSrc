This directory contains support for flashing Intel(R) StrongARM(R)
Evaluation Boards (EBSA-285 and SA-IOP) over the PCI bus of a PC
running Linux.

There are two parts to this support: a loadable kernel module
and the flash utility.

The loadable kernel module is safl.o and the utility is
sa_flash.

To build:

  * cd to this directory.
  * make

This builds safl.o and sa_flash. The kernel module must be
installed and a device file created for it. Both of these
operations require root permissions.

Install the module by:

  % insmod safl.o

Create the device file by:

  % mknod /dev/safl c 10 178


Then, to flash an image onto the eval board:

  % sa_flash image_file


The eval boards must be configured for blank programming before
flashing them. The image is placed in the flash boot sector.
