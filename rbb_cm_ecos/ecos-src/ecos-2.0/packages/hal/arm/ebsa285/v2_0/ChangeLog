2003-02-13  Patrick Doyle  <wpd@delcomsys.com>
	* src/ebsa285_misc.c: Replaced explicit prototype of memset with
	#include <string.h>.

2002-08-02  Andrew Lunn <Andrew.Lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/redboot_cmds.c: Redboot exec command can now be disabled by CDL
	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: Support needed for above.
	
2002-05-14  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/ebsa285_misc.c: Fixed warning.

2002-05-07  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: 
	Standardize CYGNUM_HAL_VIRTUAL_VECTOR_CONSOLE_CHANNEL_DEFAULT usage.

2002-04-29  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/mem285.S:
	Don't use .file as it can confuse debugging since the .file
	doesn't contain the path and therefore the debugger will never
	know where it lives! This conflicts with using -Wa,--gstabs.

2002-04-26  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* misc/redboot_ROMRAM.ecm: Brought up to date with RAM and ROM ecm
	files.

2002-04-24  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: CYGPRI_KERNEL_TESTS_DHRYSTONE_PASSES
	defined.

2002-04-03  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* misc/redboot_ROM.ecm: 
	* misc/redboot_RAM.ecm: Update for new RedBoot support, using generic
	network drivers.

2002-03-05  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* misc/redboot_ROM.ecm: Added dns+zlib packages.
	* misc/redboot_RAM.ecm: Same.

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_romram.mlt: Ditto.
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_ram.mlt: Move app base to 0x30000 to
	allow for romram space.
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_ram.ldi: Regenerate.

	* misc/redboot_ROMRAM.ecm: New file.

2001-08-22  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/redboot_cmds.c: 
	printf() is no longer a part of RedBoot.  Thus all programs
	must use diag_printf() and related functions instead.

2001-06-21  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* images/*: Remove. Don't bloat repository with things already on
	the web.

2001-04-26  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* misc/redboot_ROM.ecm: 
	* misc/redboot_RAM.ecm: Remove CYGSEM_HAL_VIRTUAL_VECTOR_DIAG from
	the import file; it's now calculated in the common HAL so no need
	to set it here.

2001-04-16  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: Add CDL to describe CPU family.

2001-03-08  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: Removed
	CYGINT_HAL_VIRTUAL_VECTOR_SUPPORT_GUARANTEED which is now the
	default.

2001-02-23  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_cache.h (HAL_FLASH_CACHES_OLD_MACROS):  This platform
	uses deprecated cache handling macros.

2001-02-23  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* misc/redboot_ROM.ecm: Renamed from redboot_ROM.cfg

	* misc/redboot_RAM.ecm: Renamed from redboot_RAM.cfg

2001-02-13  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/ebsa285_misc.c (hal_IRQ_handler): 
	Return CYGNUM_HAL_INTERRUPT_NONE for spurious interrupts.

2001-02-08  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_diag.c: Replace CYGSEM_HAL_DIAG_MANGLER_None with
	CYGDBG_HAL_DIAG_TO_DEBUG_CHAN.

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: Respect channel configuration
	constraints.

2001-01-31  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_diag.c: Replaced CYGDBG_HAL_DIAG_DISABLE_GDB_PROTOCOL
	with CYGSEM_HAL_DIAG_MANGLER_None

2001-01-26  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_diag.c: Removed CYGSEM_HAL_VIRTUAL_VECTOR_DIAG check.
	* include/plf_stub.h: Moved reset macro to
	* include/hal_platform_ints.h: this file.

2001-01-03  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/ebsa285_misc.c (hal_delay_us): Slight rearrangement to
	ensure this works properly on all speeds of platform.

2000-12-11  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: 
	Enable CYGINT_HAL_VIRTUAL_VECTOR_SUPPORT_GUARANTEED - required
	to fully support RedBoot networking I/O and ^C.

2000-12-08  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: Build redboot_cmds.c in the right place.

2000-12-04  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_cache.h: Consistently ensure that ARM registers used
	in MCR ops to cache-control coprocessors, where the data doesn't
	matter, all actually have data zero ("SBZ") as in the Jaggar book.
	This may well not be necessary, but for the sake of making sure...

2000-12-01  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/redboot_cmds.c: Add prototype to remove warning.

2000-11-30  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/redboot_cmds.c (do_exec): Complete support for loading
	Linux, including use of an initial ramdisk image.

2000-12-01  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_cache.h: Define addressable cache line operations
	HAL_DCACHE_STORE(), HAL_DCACHE_INVALIDATE(), HAL_DCACHE_FLUSH()
	now that I have understood how come the test (kcache2) was
	failing.  See kernel ChangeLog for details.  Also tidied up a
	couple of other minor details.

2000-11-28  Drew Moseley  <dmoseley@redhat.com>

	* misc/redboot_RAM.cfg: Implement CYGSEM_REDBOOT_BSP_SYSCALLS.
	* misc/redboot_ROM.cfg: Ditto.

	* src/ebsa285_misc.c (ebsa285_program_new_stack): New function
	for switching to an application stack when running a program under
	a ROM monitor.

	* cdl/hal_arm_sa11x0_ebsa285.cdl: Define HAL_ARCH_PROGRAM_NEW_STACK.

2000-11-19  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: Define CYGBLD_HAL_PLATFORM_IO_H.

	* src/redboot_cmds.c: Fix 'exec' command to handle Linux
	kernel.  Includes support to relocate image before startup.

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: Fix some minor comments.

2000-11-14    <gthomas@laptop_local>

	* include/hal_ebsa285.h (EBSA285_RAM_BANK0_BASE): Correct for SA110/285.

2000-11-13    <gthomas@laptop_local>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: Fix out of date ROM/RAM description.

2000-10-18  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/redboot_cmds.c: New file: only built in redboot, for a
	platform specific command to exec code with no MMU intervention.
	This is used to execute standard Linux kernels with as little
	change/perturbation as possible.

	* include/hal_ebsa285.h (EBSA285_RAM_BANK0_BASE): New symbol for
	redboot_cmds.c

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: Add build redboot_cmds.c -> libextras.

2000-09-17  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: Add platform/cpu identification strings.

2000-09-06  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl (CYGHWR_HAL_ARM_EBSA285_PCI_MEM_MAP_BASE
	CYGHWR_HAL_ARM_EBSA285_PCI_MEM_MAP_SIZE): Add strong constraints
	to the alignment and size of the PCI window by means of
	legal_values lists so that runtime can check that the MLTs opinion
	of the memory usage is valid. [This is related to CR 902624-CR,
	"MLT needs to be configuration aware"]

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_ram.h:
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_ram.ldi:
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_ram.mlt:
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_rom.h:
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_rom.ldi:
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_rom.mlt:
	Regenerate these from the MLT featuring a "pci_window" section in
	order to prevent the greedy heap code comsuming all of memory.
	The pci_window section is from 0xf00000 of size 0x100000
	i.e. Megabyte number 15, at the top of (default) memory.
	Unfortunately my previous quick fix (2000-08-15) for this had not
	in fact worked, because of the "clever" code which looks for
	add-in memory and consumes *that* too, unconditionally...  [This
	is related to CR 902624-CR, "MLT needs to be configuration aware"]

2000-08-18  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h: Initialize the world if you are
	blowing away previous state rather than only in ROM start.  This
	makes it possible to create a standalone RAM app that will work
	with either RedBoot in ROM or old-style GDB stubs, or any other
	loader you might find.

	Incidentally I now understand why Gary found it necessary to force
	PCI reset (2000-08-07) - with RedBoot in ROM, the RAM app was
	unconditionally reinitializing the PCI bus when it was already
	initialized, without resetting it.  We cannot play the same game
	here as with hal_platform_setup.h - I tried - because otherwise
	the net cannot re-initialize itself; the scan for devices fails.

2000-08-16  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h (CYGHWR_LED_MACRO): Use an address
	that works for a customer's own not-quite-exactly-like an EBSA
	board.  It works fine on a real EBSA too of course.
	[CASE 104355]

2000-08-15  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_ram.h (CYGMEM_REGION_ram_SIZE):
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_rom.h (CYGMEM_REGION_ram_SIZE):
	Do not "helpfully" consume all of memory for the heap, including
	PCI space, unconditionally; leave the PCI window alone.

2000-08-07  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/plf_io.h (HAL_PCI_INIT): Force PCI reset, just for
	good measure.

2000-08-03  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/ebsa285_misc.c (hal_delay_us): New routine, used for 
	hardware delays when no kernel timers are available.

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h (PLATFORM_SETUP1): Don't re-init
	hardware for RAM startup.  Doing so keeps network debugging from
	working (PCI gets shutdown, etc).

2000-07-25  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_ram.mlt: Add heap1 section for malloc
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_ram.ldi: Regenerate
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_ram.h: Regenerate
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_rom.mlt: Add heap1 section for malloc

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_rom.h: Regenerate

	* src/ebsa285_misc.c (hal_arm_mem_real_region_top): Remove warnings

2000-07-17  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_diag.c (cyg_hal_plf_serial_isr): Return value was not
	always correct.

2000-07-04  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/plf_stub.c: [deleted]
	* src/hal_diag.c:
	* src/ebsa285_misc.c: 
	* include/plf_stub.h: 
	* include/hal_platform_ints.h: 
	* include/hal_diag.h: 
	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: 
	Changed to use virtual vector table.

2000-07-04  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: This platform implements
	CYGINT_HAL_ARM_MEM_REAL_REGION_TOP

	* src/ebsa285_misc.c (hal_arm_mem_real_region_top): Add to allow
	true memory sizes to be reported, for the benefit of dynamic memory
	systems

2000-06-19  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h: 
	'hal_dram_size' is now a properly defined variable (no more
	fixed 0x40 stuff).

2000-06-18  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_ram.ldi: 
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_ram.mlt: 
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_rom.ldi: 
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_rom.mlt: 
	Incorporate new fixed vectors (used on all ARM platforms).

2000-02-29  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

        * include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_ram.h:
        * include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_ram.ldi:

        * include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_rom.ldi:
        * include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_rom.mlt:
	Align all sections on word boundaries

2000-02-24  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/mem285.S (__mem285_init): Re-do the SDRAM initialization
	until a consistent answer is acquired twice in a row.  We have
	been seeing test failures with the SDRAM initialization in the
	board with 32Mb - the SDRAM setup is screwey; hope this fixes it.

2000-02-21  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: Remove -mstructure-size-boundary=8
	option - no longer needed to build working network code.

2000-02-18  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl (CYGBLD_BUILD_GDB_STUBS): When
	building stubs, define every dependency required here rather than
	in the template

2000-02-10  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_cache.h (HAL_ICACHE_INVALIDATE_ALL):
	(HAL_DCACHE_INVALIDATE_ALL): Also invalidate TLBs in case the
	reason for the cache invalidate is a MM table rewrite.

2000-02-10  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/plf_stub.h:
	HAL_STUB_PLATFORM_STUBS_INIT->HAL_STUB_PLATFORM_INIT
	
	* src/hal_diag.c: 
	* misc/stubrom.perm:  [removed]
	* misc/STUBS_config:  [added]
	* include/pkgconf/hal_arm_ebsa285.h: 
	Removed stubs as a legal startup type.

2000-02-09  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl (CYGBLD_GLOBAL_CFLAGS): Permanently set
	the -mstructure-size-boundary=8 compilation option, as required by
	the initial version of the OpenBSD network stack port, currently
	software under development.

2000-02-07  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: Use cpu option when linking.

2000-02-04  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

       * include/hal_platform_setup.h (INIT_XBUS_ACCESS): 
       (CYGHWR_LED_MACRO): Fix a typo - "and" alone doesn't set
       conditions, so branch depending on "PCI arbiter enabled" was taken
       randomly.

2000-02-03  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: Implements stubs.

2000-01-31  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_ebsa285.h: Correct misleading comment.

2000-01-27  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: Moved part of stubs build rule to
	common HAL. Changed description.

2000-01-26  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: Removed below. Target does not have
	CygMon support.

2000-01-25  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

       * cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: Added cygmon console device
       config. Added make rule for binary conversion of cygmon image.

2000-01-24  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: Add stubs build rule.

2000-01-24  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/*.cdl:

	Remove obsolete option CYGTST_TESTING_IDENTIFIER.

2000-01-19  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/*.cdl: Add descriptions to a number of options &c which were
	lacking same, also tidied up other typos as noticed en passant.

2000-01-10  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/ebsa285_misc.c (hal_IRQ_handler): Conditionally remove
	debugging check for FIQ sources being active at customer's
	request; they are now using FIQ via VSR so the warning message is
	unwanted.

1999-11-25  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_diag.c: Conditionalize def of diag_buffer for only when it's
	explicitly wanted and someone hacks the code
	(hal_diag_write_char): Likewise

1999-11-25  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_rom.h: 
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_ram.h: Update 'do not edit' strings.

1999-11-16  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/sdram0.cxx: New file to test SDRAM initialization.  It is
	somewhat EBSA specific in that it sanity checks the control reg
	setup as well as testing memory per se.

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: build the new test.

	* tests/PKGconf.mak: New file: build the new test.

1999-11-16  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/mem285.S: Rewrite, essentially: it was the only way to get a
	good enough handle on what this nasty, trick stuff does.  I'm very
	happy with it now.  It's also callable for RAM startup too, to
	happily count up the RAMs as initialized: no guessing ever again!

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h: Delete some code!  Now that mem285
	initialization is sorted out, it's cool to do exactly the same
	thing for ROM and RAM startup; the mem init code differs, mind, to
	just add up the memory sizes in RAM start.

1999-11-10  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h (PLATFORM_FLUSH_DISABLE_CACHES):
	Also flush TLBs - this is vital when changing cachability &c
	during startup.  Also do that same flush in ROM start, for when we
	build to run in flash block #1 following POST executing, when
	"stuff" might be in an odd state.

1999-11-09  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_ram.h:

1999-11-09  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: 
	* include/pkgconf/hal_arm_ebsa285.h:
	* src/ebsa285_misc.c: 
	Remap PCI accessible memory as non-cachable. Changed default
	PCI mapped memory to the top 1MB of a 16MB system.

1999-11-01  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: Remove define_proc comments.

	Increased memory size to 16MB.
	
1999-10-27  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_diag.c: Fixed conditional include.

1999-10-26  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_diag.c (hal_diag_write_char): Use new macro
	CYG_HAL_GDB_ENTER_CRITICAL_IO_REGION and its mate to control
	stepping through gdb $O packet output.

1999-10-26  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h (CYGHWR_LED_MACRO): Define.

1999-10-26  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl:

	Rename CYGBLD_GLOBAL_PREFIX to
	CYGBLD_GLOBAL_COMMAND_PREFIX

1999-10-20  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl:
	Define build-related and memory layout-related CDL options.

1999-10-11  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>
	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl: 
	* include/plf_io.h:
	* include/pkgconf/hal_arm_ebsa285.h: 
	Added configurability of EBSA memory accessible from PCI space.

	* src/ebsa285_misc.c (hal_bsp_mmu_init): Folded XBus into 21285 regs.

	Define CYGTST_TESTING_IDENTIFIER.

1999-10-05  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* support/linux/safl_util/sa_flash.c: Add a lot of extra
	diagnostics and some new options; did this in the course of
	finding out whether a board really was dead or not, so may as well
	commit it.

1999-09-24  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/plf_io.h (HAL_PCI_INIT): Fix rookie code bug.

1999-09-01  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_ebsa285.h (ARM_MMU_SECTION): Move these macros and
	memory-layout structure definitions here from ebsa285_misc.c so
	that others can use them.

	* src/ebsa285_misc.c (hal_IRQ_handler): Scan FIQ sources also and
	print a warning if any are active.
	(hal_hardware_init): Clear the FIQ enable mask at startup too;
	this was assumed to be cleared at reset, but just in case...
	(ARM_MMU_SECTION): Move these macros and memory-layout structure
	definitions from here to include/hal_ebsa285.h so that others can
	use them.
	
	* src/hal_diag.c (hal_diag_write_char): Do not unconditionally
	poke the XBUS LED location - XBUS may not be available if internal
	21285 arbiter is in use.
	(hal_diag_write_char): Fix warnings for proto of
	cyg_hal_gdb_interrupt().
	
1999-09-01  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

1999-08-19  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h (BASIC_PCI_SETUP): [+untabified]
	* include/plf_io.h (HAL_PCI_INIT): 
	Changed PCI enable comment to match actual behavior.

1999-08-17  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/plf_io.h: Rename HAL_PCI_CONFIG_INTERRUPT to
	HAL_PCI_TRANSLATE_INTERRUPT.
	Read _PIN instead of _LINE.

1999-08-16  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/plf_io.h (HAL_PCI_CONFIG_INTERRUPT): Added.

1999-08-13  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/plf_io.h: Renamed macros and added resource information.
	Renaming again.
	
1999-08-12  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_arm_ebsa285.cdl:
	Define CYG_HAL_STARTUP and CYGHWR_MEMORY_LAYOUT.

1999-08-12  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/plf_io.h: Added PCI macros.

1999-08-12  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl: Added CDL for ebsa.

1999-08-12  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h: 
	* include/hal_ebsa285.h: 
	Renamed some PCI registers and moved out generic PCI stuff.

1999-08-10  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_ebsa285.h: Added more definitions.

	* include/plf_stub.h (HAL_STUB_PLATFORM_RESET): Defined.

1999-08-04  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/ebsa285_misc.c (ARM_ACCESS_TYPE_x): each domain has two bits.

1999-07-26  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_rom.mlt: 
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_ram.mlt: 

	Fix memory section alignments to match those of the pre-built
	linker script fragments.

1999-07-26  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_rom.mlt: 
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_ram.mlt: 
	Make these match the .ldi files that do the linking proper, so
	that the process is reversible and the .ldi files recreatable.

1999-07-26  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_platform_ints.h (CYGDBG_HAL_CTRLC_ISR): Define this
	if needed so that the arch HAL can conditionally call our poll
	routine.  Problem is that CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_CTRLC_SUPPORT *is*
	defined for platforms that do not support it.

1999-07-23  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_diag.c (hal_ctrlc_isr): Define this function, which is
	called from the default ISR, if CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_CTRLC_SUPPORT
	is defined.  It looks for a ^C in the serial input and bangs out
	with a breakpoint if one arrives.  Note that you cannot do much at
	all after this bp, except examine the stack and see where the
	program had got to.
	(hal_diag_write_char): Do not eat response characters from GDB:
	leave them for the ISR mentioned above to test for ^C.

	* src/ebsa285_misc.c (hal_hardware_init): Unmask the interrupt for
	serial reception, so that we can scan for incoming ^C, if the
	option CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_CTRLC_SUPPORT is defined.

1999-07-23  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_platform_ints.h (CYG_GDB_DEV_INT, CYG_DIAG_DEV_INT):
	define these so that interrupting using ^C and so on will work.

1999-07-22  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@masala.cygnus.co.uk>

	* support/README: New file.
	* support/linux/README: New file.
	* support/linux/safl_util/README: New file.
	* support/linux/safl_util/Makefile: New file.
	* support/linux/safl_util/sa_flash.c: New file.
	* support/linux/safl_util/safl.c: New file.
	Keep the devo safl_utils for programming ebsa-285 FLASH in the
	eCos tree too, so that it gets into our releases.

1999-07-21  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h (PLATFORM_SETUP1): Get ROM startup
	to work OK; tidy up RAM start in consequence.  Do not set
	CYGHWR_HAL_ARM_HAS_MMU so that we jump straight into high ROM.
	Remove consequently unused macros.

	* src/ebsa285_misc.c: Pass DRAM size as detected at startup around
	correctly; worry less about alignment of MMU page table thingy.

	* src/hal_diag.c: Make ROM startup systems output in clear.

	* src/mem285.S: Get rid of all that IMM() nonsense.

	* misc/stubrom.perm: NEW FILE: Add instructions for making a STUBROM.

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_rom.ldi: Get the numbers right
	for ROM startup.

1999-07-19  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@masala.cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/mem285.S: New file: offers routine __mem285_init, for DRAM
	sizing before the MMU is set up.  Code borrowed from CygMon/BSP of
	course.

	* src/ebsa285_misc.c: Add the meat of the 'C' initialization here;
	MMU initialization is the main addition.  Code borrowed from
	CygMon/BSP.

	* src/PKGconf.mak (COMPILE): Add mem285.S, which contains tricky
	DRAM sizing and init code - which of course can only be run from
	ROM, since it is damaging to the contents of DRAM.

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h (PLATFORM_SETUP1): Add required
	startup code in various macros to make constructing one phrase for
	ROM vs RAM startup easier, and for debug.  Code borrowed from
	CygMon/BSP.

	* src/hal_diag.c (hal_diag_init): Initialize the hardware, by
	setting the baud rate.

	* include/hal_ebsa285.h (ARM_FIRST_LEVEL_PAGE_TABLE_SIZE): Add
	this and a few other symbols for the DRAM sizing and MMU init
	code.

1999-07-16  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/hal_arm_ebsa285.h: Typo in tidy up of config
	info.  Doh!

1999-07-16  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/hal_arm_ebsa285.h: Tidy up config info.

1999-07-15  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/ebsa285_misc.c (hal_hardware_init): Enable the caches in
	here; they are now disabled during startup.

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h (PLATFORM_SETUP1): Added code to
	disable caches [if RAM start] and switch to the ROM address
	[regardless, since it's the RAM addr if RAM start so harmless]

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_ebsa285_rom.ldi: Set up some of the
	values here while they are in my head; see above.

1999-07-15  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/hal_cache.h: Tidy up cache macros and make semantics
	better match what the GDB stubs require.

1999-07-15  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/sa-110.h: removed, it was added in error.  Its contents
	live in include/hal_ebsa285.h
