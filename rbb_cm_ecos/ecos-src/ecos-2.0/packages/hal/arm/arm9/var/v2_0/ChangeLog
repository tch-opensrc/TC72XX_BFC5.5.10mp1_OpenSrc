2003-01-08  Patrick Doyle  <wpd@delcomsys.com>

	* include/hal_cache.h: Changed HAL_ICACHE_LINE_SIZE and
	HAL_DCACHE_LINE_SIZE to match the documentation from TI.  Now the
	kcache2 test passes the two tests that it runs.

2002-03-06  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_cache.h: Added support for ARM966E. This does not
	have a cache, so this involved adding support for cacheless ARM9s
	in general.

	* cdl/hal_arm_arm9.cdl: Added option for ARM966E.

2002-01-28  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_cache.h: Only define HAL_VIRT_TO_PHYS_ADDRESS if it
	isn't already defined. This needs renaming and a cleanup, but this
	quick #ifdef hack fixes a compiler warning.

	* cdl/hal_arm_arm9.cdl: Declare var_io.h.

	* include/var_io.h: Added.

2001-11-16  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/arm9_misc.c (hal_hardware_init): Don't invalidate caches on
	RAM startup.

2001-11-07  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/arm9_misc.c (cyg_hal_arm9_soft_reset): Also put CPU in SVC
	mode (as after a reset). Still broken though.

2001-11-06  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_cache.h: Add virtual->physical translation setup.

2001-11-01  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/arm9_misc.c (cyg_hal_arm9_soft_reset): Attempt at soft
	reset. Doesn't quite work though, and it's unclear why.

2001-10-28  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_cache.h: Fix DATA cache flush for 920,922.  This was
	off-by-one, leaving part of the cache unflushed.

2001-08-13  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_cache.h: Support ARM variants 920, 922, 925 and 940.

2001-04-30  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/arm9_misc.c (hal_hardware_init): Use CDL configuration to
	decide which caches should be enabled at startup time.

2001-04-26  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/arm9_misc.c (hal_hardware_init): Caches just don't seem to work.

	* include/hal_cache.h: Fix cache parameters - 16K x 16K

2001-04-18  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/arm9_misc.c: Update copyright.
	* include/hal_cache.h: Same.
	* cdl/hal_arm_arm9.cdl: Same.

2001-04-16  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_arm9.cdl: Add CDL to describe CPU family.

2001-04-03  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/arm9_misc.c: Removed hal_arm9.h
	* include/hal_cache.h: Same.
	* include/hal_arm9.h: Deleted.

2000-12-04  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_cache.h: Consistently ensure that ARM registers used
	in MCR ops to cache-control coprocessors, where the data doesn't
	matter, all actually have data zero ("SBZ") as in the Jaggar book.
	This may well not be necessary, but for the sake of making sure...

2000-11-27  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_cache.h
	(HAHAL_FLASH_CACHES_ON/HAL_FLASH_CACHES_OFF): Defined.

	* src/arm9_misc.c (hal_hardware_init): Disable caches. Wasted too
	much time on this already.

2000-11-23  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_cache.h (HAL_DCACHE_SYNC): Wait for cache dirty flag
	to clear.

2000-11-22  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/arm9_misc.c (hal_hardware_init): Don't disable caches.

2000-11-21  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_cache.h (HAL_DCACHE_INVALIDATE_ALL): Remove
	writeback buffer flush.

	* cdl/hal_arm_arm9.cdl: Removed clock options.

	* src/arm9_misc.c: Cleaned up, enabled caches.

	* include/hal_cache.h: Enable cache controls, fix invalidate
	macro.

2000-11-15  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/arm9_misc.c: Disable/clear caches. Removed clock handling.

	* include/hal_cache.h: Changed to match ARM925, but prevent
	enabling. Messes up flash programming.

2000-11-14  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* Created.
