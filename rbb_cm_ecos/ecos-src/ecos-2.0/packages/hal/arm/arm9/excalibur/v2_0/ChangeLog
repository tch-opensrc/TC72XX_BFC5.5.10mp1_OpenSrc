	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_arm9_excalibur_redboot.h: Added new
	REDBOOT startup mode that is similar in function to the ROMRAM
	starup mode, with the exception that (RedBoot) application memory

	* cdl/hal_arm_arm9_excalibur.cdl: Disable D-cache again.

2001-08-14  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/excalibur_misc.c (hal_mmu_init): Don't let flash be cached:
	appears to cause a bus lock when accessed from RAM.

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h: Only copy code when in ROMRAM
	startup configuration.

	* src/excalibur_misc.c (hal_delay_us): Use timer.

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h: Better ROMRAM startup.

	count register. Appears that FIFO jams on overruns somehow, and
	messes up the ISR state in the process. Try to work around that by
	checking both FIFO count and ISR RI flag. It works. Sort of.

	* src/excalibur_misc.c (hal_delay_us): Do nothing for now. Real
	code changed a bit too. 

	* include/excalibur.h: Fixed typo in FIFO register defs.

	* cdl/hal_arm_arm9_excalibur.cdl: Changed baud rate to 9600 until

	entries. Do DPSRAM init (not that it should make a difference).

	* include/excalibur.h: Fixed mmap sizes. Fixed SDRAM map
	size. Added some debug code. Added DPSRAM defs.
