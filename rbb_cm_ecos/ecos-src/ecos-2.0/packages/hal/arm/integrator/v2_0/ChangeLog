	* cdl/hal_arm_integrator.cdl: thumb is not supported so the
	reference to thumb-elf was spurious.

2002-05-27  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_integrator.cdl: Don't run cache tests.

2002-05-07  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_integrator.cdl: 
	Standardize CYGNUM_HAL_VIRTUAL_VECTOR_CONSOLE_CHANNEL_DEFAULT usage.

2002-03-19  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* include/plf_io.h: Added volatiles to PCI config accesses. These
	should have been noticed ages ago!

2002-03-14  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* include/plf_stub.h: Added data access check macros
	CYG_HAL_STUB_PERMIT_DATA_READ() and
	CYG_HAL_STUB_PERMIT_DATA_WRITE() for use by GDB stubs.

	* cdl/hal_arm_integrator.cdl: Added -fno-schedule-insns to ARM7
	compile line option. There seem to be some issues in the ethernet
	driver when scheduling instructions.

2002-03-08  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* src/integrator_misc.c (cyg_plf_pci_init): Only actually init PCI
	bridge for non-RAM configurations. Reinitializing during RAM
	startup kills any PCI devices. This is particularly a problem if
	we are debugging via the ethernet.

2002-03-07  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* misc/redboot_ROMRAM.ecm: Added zlib.

	* cdl/hal_arm_integrator.cdl: Require more flash for the RedBoot
	image, but remove the backup image to compensate.

2002-03-06  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* src/integrator_misc.c:
	Added hal_delay_us() and initialized clock in plf_hardware_init()
	to make it work in RedBoot.
	Moved PCI initialization from macro to cyg_plf_pci_init().

	* src/hal_diag.c: Fixed ISR to operate correctly. Removed legacy
	code.

	* misc/redboot_ROMRAM.ecm: Added this file to support ROMRAM
	startup redboot.

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_integrator_ram.ldi: 
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_integrator_ram.h:
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_integrator_rom.ldi: 
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_integrator_rom.h:
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_integrator_romram.ldi: 
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_integrator_romram.h:
	Added ROMRAM startup files. Fixed up ROM and RAM files to reflect
	use of PCI window.
	Note: MLT files not updated!

	* include/plf_io.h: Moved contents of HAL_PCI_INIT() out to
	src/integrator_misc.c. Added CYGARC_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS(). Fixed 32
	bit PCI config accesses to use two 16 bit accesses - the stright
	32 bit accesses do not seem to work.

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h: Added support for ROMRAM startup.
	Tidied up a bit.

	* include/hal_platform_ints.h: Added HAL_DELAY_US() and
	implemented HAL_PLATFORM_RESET().

	* include/hal_integrator.h: Move HAL_FLASH_WRITE_ENABLE() and
	HAL_FLASH_WRITE_DISABLE() out to integrator FLASH device driver.

	* cdl/hal_arm_integrator.cdl:
	Added support for ARM7 and ARM9 variants. Generally tidied up.

2002-01-28  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_integrator.cdl: Removed explicit declaration of
	plf_io.h

2001-10-30  Philippe Robin <Philippe.Robin@arm.com>

	* Initial version of integrator package.
