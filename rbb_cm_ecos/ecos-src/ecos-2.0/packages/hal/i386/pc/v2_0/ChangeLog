2003-04-10  Nick Garnett  <nickg@balti.calivar.com>

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_i386_pc_rom.ldi: Brought list of sections up
	to date with other files.

2003-01-22  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* include/pkgconf/hal_i386_pc.h: Old file. Remove.

2002-11-28  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/plf_stub.c: Removed redundant reinitialization of VSR table
	in hal_pc_stubs_init(). This has already been done in
	hal_platform_init() and reinitializing here destroys the FPU
	switch VSR.

	* src/plf_misc.c (hal_platform_init):
	Added configuration and test to avoid overwriting the FPU switch
	VSR with the default VSR. This caused problems with stand-alone
	application that use lazy FPU switching.
	Moved call to hal_ctrlc_isr_init() to after call to
	hal_if_init(). Previously, stand-alone applications had problems
	with ctrl-c handling because the CALL_HACK stuff didn't work.

	* cdl/hal_i386_pc.cdl:
	Added GRUB startup option. This enables support for booting from
	the GRUB bootloader.
	Added CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_INITIAL_BREAK option to force a
	breakpoint just before calling cyg_start(). This is insinuated
	into the CYGPKG_HAL_DEBUG part of the tree, and conditioned to
	only work for stand-alone apps with the stubs included.

	* include/platform.inc: Added GRUB startup support.

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_i386_pc_grub.mlt: 
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_i386_pc_grub.ldi: 
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_i386_pc_grub.h: 
	Added these MLT files to support the new GRUB startup option.

	* misc/menu.lst: Added this example GRUB menu configuration file.
	
2002-05-07  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_i386_pc.cdl: 
	Standardize CYGNUM_HAL_VIRTUAL_VECTOR_CONSOLE_CHANNEL_DEFAULT usage.

2002-04-29  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/romboot.S:
	Don't use .file as it can confuse debugging since the .file
	doesn't contain the path and therefore the debugger will never
	know where it lives! This conflicts with using -Wa,--gstabs.

2002-04-23  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_i386_pc.cdl: Remove unused compile line.

2001-12-07  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* include/plf_intr.h: Added definition of HAL_DELAY_US() so that
	this is used instead of the delay loop in delay_us(). This is
	necessary to handle fast Pentiums and Athlons.

	* misc/redboot_FLOPPY_D850GB.ecm: Removed reference to SMP.

2001-10-16  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* misc/redboot_FLOPPY_D850GB.ecm: New file. RedBoot config for
	Intel D850GB motherboard.

	* src/hal_diag.c: Setup pc_ser_channels based on CDL.

2001-10-12  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_i386_pc.cdl: Parent CYGBLD_BUILD_REDBOOT_BIN_ROM and
	CYGBLD_BUILD_REDBOOT_BIN_FLOPPY under a CYGBLD_BUILD_REDBOOT_BIN_ROM
	component for better cross-platform consistency.

2001-10-08  Ian Campbell  <icampbell@arcom.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_i386_pc.cdl: CYGBLD_BUILD_I386_ROMBOOT and
	CYGBLD_BUILD_REDBOOT_BIN_ROM moved here from hal_i386.cdl in the
	arch package. Rename CYGBLD_BUILD_REDBOOT_BIN to
	CYGBLD_BUILD_REDBOOT_BIN_FLOPPY for consistency.
	* src/romboot.S: Moved from arch package.
	* src/romboot.ld: Moved from arch package.

2001-10-05  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/plf_stub.c (hal_pc_stubs_init): Install idt entry for GNUPro
	syscalls.

	* misc/redboot_FLOPPY.ecm: Turn on CYGSEM_REDBOOT_BSP_SYSCALLS.

	* include/plf_misc.h: Add extern decl for cyg_hal_pc_set_idt_entry.

2001-10-02  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_i386_pc.cdl 
	(CYGNUM_HAL_VIRTUAL_VECTOR_CONSOLE_CHANNEL_DEFAULT): Allow user to
	change value.

2001-09-28  Ian Campbell  <icampbell@arcom.co.uk>

	* include/platform.inc (hal_cpu_init): Initialise %ss.
	Be more pedantic about register names matching opcode suffixes.

2001-09-07  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* misc/redboot_FLOPPY.ecm: Disable
	CYGSEM_REDBOOT_VALIDATE_USER_RAM_LOADS
	* misc/redboot_ROM.ecm: Ditto.
	* misc/redboot_FLOPPY_SMP.ecm: Ditto.

2001-09-05  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/plf_misc.c (hal_platform_init): If not RAM startup, install
	exception VSRs.

2001-08-22  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_i386_pc_floppy.ldi:
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_i386_pc_floppy.mlt:
	Moved load base address from 0x2000 to 0x3000.
	We now use page 0x2000 for SMP related data including the slave
	CPU startup trampoline and various data structures that need to be
	shared between RedBoot and the application.

	* misc/redboot_FLOPPY_SMP.ecm: Added this file to configure an
	SMP-aware RedBoot floppy. If SMP applications are to be run it is
	essential that this version of RedBoot be used because a degree of
	cooperation is required to get the CPUs going, and to handle
	exceptions cleanly.

	* src/plf_misc.c (hal_platform_init): Added call to cyg_hal_smp_init().


	* include/platform.inc (hal_idt_init): Added entries to set up IDT
	entries 48..67.

2001-08-13  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_i386_pc.cdl: Fix CYG_HAL_STARTUP description.

2001-07-13  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_i386_pc.cdl: Added requires statement to
	CYGSEM_HAL_ROM_MONITOR option to turn off lazy FPU switching. ROM
	monitors should not be playing these kinds of games.

2001-05-22  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_i386_pc_ram.mlt: Fix pci_window description.

2001-05-03  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_i386_pc.cdl: Changed option
	CYGIMP_HAL_I386_PCMB_SCREEN_SUPPORT to interface
	CYGINT_HAL_I386_PCMB_SCREEN_SUPPORT.

2001-04-30  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]
	* cdl/hal_i386_pc.cdl: Added options to convert ELF file to binary
	for copying to a floppy disc.

	* include/platform.inc: Modified ROM startup to work with romboot.S.

	* cdl/hal_i386_pc.cdl: Modified options to allow for ROM startup.

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_i386_pc_ram.mlt: 
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_i386_pc_ram.ldi: 
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_i386_pc_ram.h:
	Fixed some bugs in these files with the size and layout of
	RAM. This was causing the heap to be badly mangled.

2001-03-14  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]
	* src/plf_misc.c (hal_platform_init): Added call to
	hal_pcmb_init().

	* include/platform.inc:	Removed memory size stuff.

2001-03-13  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]

	* include/platform.inc: Removed some now redundant code.

2001-03-08  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]
	* src/plf_misc.c: ISR tables and cyg_hal_pc_set_idt_entry() moved
	here from hal_startup.c. ISR table setup code tidied.
	hal_delay_us() now works in 1s bursts to avoid arithmetic
	overflow.

	* src/hal_diag.c: Most of contents of file moved out to
	pcmb_serial.c and pcmb_screen.c. This remains as an intialization
	interface for those.

	appropriate places.
	
2001-03-06  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	[x86 branch]
	* src/var_misc.c: Rewrote clock init and access functions in terms
	of HAL IO macros.

	* src/plf_misc.c (hal_pc_fpe_dsr): Raise the base stack address by
	CYGNUM_KERNEL_THREADS_STACK_CHECK_DATA_SIZE if that is defined;
	otherwise a stack overflow would immediately be reported.

2000-11-02  Fabrice Gautier <Fabrice_Gautier@sdesigns.com>

	* src/platform.inc (hal_cpu_init): Load image from floppy one
        sector at a time to avoid "DMA access across 64k boundary" error.

2000-08-18  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/platform.inc:
	* include/var_intr.h:

2000-03-15  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/hal_diag.c: Added code to handle keyboard input on PC when
	using SCREEN diagnostics. This is as much for completeness and
	future use than for any pressing current need.

	* include/platform.inc: Fixed some mismatches between instruction
	suffixes and operand sizes that the latest i386 assembler now
	warns about. Also tidied up GDT and IDT load code and protected
	mode switch because of warnings from assembler.

2000-03-09  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/platform.inc:
	* cdl/hal_i386_pc.cdl: Rename CYGHWR_HAL_STARTUP to

	also be used.

2000-03-01  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/plf_stub.c (cyg_hal_gdb_isr): Added check for a character
	being available at the serial line. With the introduction of GDB O
	packet debugging, it is possible for this code to see a spurious
	interrupt and get stuck in hal_pc_get_char().

	* include/var_intr.h:
	Modified interrupt enable/disable code so that it is closer in
	behavior to other HALs.

	* include/platform.inc:
	Changed floppy bootstrap code so it can load binaries greater than
	64k and only loads the .text+.data parts, not the .bss.

2000-02-18  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* cdl/hal_i386_pc.cdl (CYGBLD_BUILD_GDB_STUBS): When
	building stubs, define every dependency required here rather than
	in the template

2000-02-18  John Dallaway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_i386_pc_ram.mlt,
	  include/pkgconf/mlt_i386_pc_floppy.mlt:

	Add/update memory layout save files to match the corresponding
	linker script fragments.

2000-02-16  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

        * src/plf_stub.c: 
        * src/var_misc.c:
	Files added to provide PC support. Most of these are based on code
