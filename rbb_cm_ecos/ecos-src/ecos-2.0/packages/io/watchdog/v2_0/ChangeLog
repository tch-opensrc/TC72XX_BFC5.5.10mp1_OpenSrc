	* cdl/watchdog.cdl: 
	watchdog2 tests timeout is not too fast (safe for both types of
	watchdog semantics).

	* src/emulate.cxx:
	* include/watchdog.hxx:
	Fixed compile errors.

	* cdl/watchdog.cdl: Only build test if the watchdog does not reset
	the board.

	* src/mn10300.cxx: Turn watchdog off in Cyg_Watchdog::trigger() to
	prevent it repeating.

1999-08-18  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/watchdog.h: Made test for use of a non-emulated
	watchdog more generic for MN10300 targets.

	* src/emulate.cxx: 
	* include/watchdog.hxx (class Cyg_Watchdog):
	Added get_resolution() to return maximum time, in nanoseconds,
	between calls to reset().

	* tests/watchdog.cxx: 
	Modified to use the value returned from get_resolution() to
	control the timing of reset() calls.
	
	* src/mn10300.cxx: 
	Added support for AM33 variant. Since the AM33 can only provide a
	maximum watchdog cycle time of 621ms, this has motiviated the
	addition of the get_resolution() call described above.

1999-04-21  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/watchdog.cxx: The 'keep alive' message was interfering
	with the watchdog measurement.  Some rearrangement fixes this.

1999-04-20  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* tests/watchdog.cxx: 
	Restrict number of loops, and number of seconds per loop when we
	detect we are in a simulator. Do this instead of changing the
	value of one_sec in the simulator, since this invalidates the test
	somewhat.
	Output occasional messages to reassure the user that the test is
	still running.
	Fix for PR 19865

	coverage. Print some additional messages, especially if failure 
	detected.  Reset watchdog after installing handler.

	PR17501: When using the emulation there is a requirement on the
