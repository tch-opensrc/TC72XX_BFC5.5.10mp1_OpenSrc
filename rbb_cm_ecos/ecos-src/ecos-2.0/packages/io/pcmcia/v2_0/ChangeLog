	* cdl/io_pcmcia.cdl: Fix doc link.

2002-04-12  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/pcmcia.h: Add prototype(s) to remove warnings.

2000-09-17  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/pcmcia.h: 
	* src/pcmcia.c (cf_register_handler): Interrupt handler must look 
	just like a DSR and will be called using the same calling conventions.

2000-08-23  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/pcmcia.c: 
	* include/pcmcia.h: Export new function to forceably clear interrupts
	on a card [slot].  Use in non-kernel environments.

2000-07-16  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/io_pcmcia.cdl: 
	* include/pcmcia.h: 
	* src/pcmcia.c: Remove dependency on generic I/O package.

2000-07-15  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/pcmcia.h: 
	* src/pcmcia.c: Change notion of interrupts to be slot oriented.
	This fits with more hardware.  Now need to "register" an IRQ
	handler when initializing a card device.
