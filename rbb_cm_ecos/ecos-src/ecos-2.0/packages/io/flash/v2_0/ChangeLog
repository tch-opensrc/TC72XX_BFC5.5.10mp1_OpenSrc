	level.

2002-01-31  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/flashiodev.c: Fix bounds checking and offsetting.

	* cdl/io_flash.cdl (CYGNUM_IO_FLASH_BLOCK_LENGTH_1): Default to
	0x100000 for convenience.

2002-01-30  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/io_flash.cdl: Allow specification of an offset and length
	of the region of flash.
	* src/flashiodev.c: Use it.

2002-01-24  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/flash.h: Add a comment about the obvious: the flash
	caching macros should be called with interrupts disabled.

2002-01-23  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/io_flash.cdl: Add CYGPKG_IO_FLASH_BLOCK_DEVICE and
	CYGDAT_IO_FLASH_BLOCK_DEVICE_NAME_1 to allow exporting flash
	as block devices accessible from file systems.
	* src/fileiodev.c: New file implementing this.
	* include/flash.h: Add typedefs for the various structures used
	to configure the block devices.

2002-01-18  Paul Fine  <pfine@delcomsys.com>

	* src/flash.c : Modified flash_verify_addr, flash_erase,
	flash_lock and flash_unlock to to work properly when the location
	of the flash in the memory map is at the very top of the address
	space.  We check and handle values that may overflow.

2001-10-28  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c (flash_erase): Don't call hardware layer if block
	appears to be already erased [faster and less wear & tear].

2001-10-25  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/flash_dev.h: Fix test of 4x16-bit flash parts.
	Spotted by Jose Pascual <josepascual@almudi.com>

2001-10-16  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c: Include string.h

	* cdl/io_flash.cdl: Package requires ISOINFRA and string
	functions.

2001-09-25  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/flash.h: Remove warning on printf() prototype.

2001-08-10  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/io_flash.cdl: Changed flavor of
	CYGHWR_IO_FLASH_BLOCK_LOCKING to booldata.
	* include/flash.h: Matching changes.
	* src/flash.c: Matching changes.

2001-07-23  David Howells  <dhowells@redhat.com>

	* cdl/io_flash.cdl: Added software write protect option.
	* include/flash.h: Ditto.

	support, and prevented low-level writes from being handed
	cross-block data chunks.

2001-07-20  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/flash.h: 
	* cdl/io_flash.cdl: Name convention: CYGINT_FLASH_WORKSPACE_SIZE 
	renamed to be CYGNUM_FLASH_WORKSPACE_SIZE.

2001-07-19  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	to control how much memory is reserved for use by FLASH drivers.

2001-06-19  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c (flash_program): Only verify program with memcmp if
	the status code suggests the programming went OK so far.
	Otherwise all errors become verify errors.

	(flash_init): Fix bug in removal of dependency of printf().  The
	pointer was not initialized until after the call into the driver.

2001-06-11  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c: 
	* include/flash.h: Remove dependency on printf() via user functions.

2001-05-23  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/flash_dev.h (FLASH_P2V): Use CYG_ADDRWORD instead of int.

	* src/flash.c: Copy functions to RAM iff
	CYGHWR_IO_FLASH_DEVICE_NOT_IN_RAM defined.

	* cdl/io_flash.cdl: Changed CYGHWR_IO_FLASH_DEVICE_IN_RAM to
	CYGHWR_IO_FLASH_DEVICE_NOT_IN_RAM.

	to control whether or not to perform extra verification of flash
	programming.
	* src/flash.c (flash_program): No verification unless
	CYGSEM_IO_FLASH_VERIFY_PROGRAM defined.

2001-03-21  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c (flash_program): Verify data after programming.

2001-03-21  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c: And its error message.

2001-03-17  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c (flash_program): 
	* include/flash.h: Add support for [StrataFLASH] buffered writes.
	This requires knowledge of the device write buffer size [saved].

2001-03-01  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c: 
	* include/flash.h: Allow platform to define pre/post routines
	to enable/disable device access.  These may be required, e.g.
	to turn on some voltage, etc.

2001-02-23  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/flash.h: HAL_FLASH_CACHES_WANT_OPTIMAL replaced with
	(opposite sense) HAL_FLASH_CACHES_OLD_MACROS.

	* src/flash.c (__anonymizer): Use to force the compiler to use
	jumps instead of branches.

2001-02-22  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/flash_dev.h: Added. Contains macros and definitions
	common to all (new style) flash device drivers.

	* include/flash.h: Added two new error codes.
	* cdl/io_flash.cdl: Added CYGHWR_IO_FLASH_DEVICE_IN_RAM.
	* src/flash.c: Made functions respect
	CYGHWR_IO_FLASH_DEVICE_IN_RAM and jump directly to the code
	instead of copying it around.
	(__arm_broken): Work around problem with ARM tools.

2001-02-06  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c (flash_erase): Add an additional argument to the
	call into the driver, being the blocksize (as discovered).  This
	allows a gross check for actual erase in some drivers.  Those that
	don't use it, it's harmless - after all, this is an API by trust.

2000-12-06  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c (flash_dev_query): Added. Allows reloc/cache magic
	to be removed from device drivers (eventually). Also fixed some
	warnings, and made function references use char[] instead of just
	char to prevent MIPS compiler from messing up.

	* include/flash.h: Added FLASH_ERR_DRV_VERIFY and flash_dev_query.

2000-11-27  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c: Do all flash access inside properly
	cache-controlled region.
	* include/flash.h: Cache definitions.

2000-11-17  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c: Added debug mode, allowing device driver to use printf.

2000-11-16  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c: Added suspend error messages.
	* include/flash.h: Same.

2000-09-01  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/flash.h: 
	* src/flash.c: CYGHWR_IO_FLASH_BLOCK_LOCKING is an interface, so
	it's always defined; look for > 0 instead.

2000-08-28  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/flash.c: 
	* include/flash.h: 
	* cdl/io_flash.cdl: Support block locking (optional by hardware).

2000-08-22  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/flash.c (flash_program): Add HAL_ICACHE_DISABLE/ENABLE pairs
	around calls to RAM copy of programming/erasing function - this is
	necessary to get reliable operation on EBSA285 and similar.
	Otherwise, what is in the instruction cache might be run instead.

2000-08-14  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/flash.h: Add block size mask for finding block boundaries.

	* src/flash.c: Use block size properly.

2000-07-29  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/flash.h: 
	* src/flash.c (flash_get_block_info): New function.
	(flash_program): Program in block_size chunks as much as possible.
