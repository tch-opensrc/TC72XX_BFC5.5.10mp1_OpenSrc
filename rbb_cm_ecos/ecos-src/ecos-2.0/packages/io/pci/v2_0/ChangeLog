2003-02-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/io_pci.cdl: Fix doc link.

2002-05-14  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/pci1.c: Fix warning.

2002-02-13  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* doc/pci.sgml: Tidy up some typos and PROGRAMLISTING width
	issues.

2002-02-11  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* doc/pci.sgml: Brought docs up to date with current code.

2002-01-31  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/pci.c (cyg_pci_init): Set default memory and io bases here
	as the HAL_PCI_ALLOC_BASE_* macros may not be static values.

2002-01-21  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* src/pci.c (cyg_pci_get_device_info): Fix setting of upper 32 bits
	for 64-bit BAR.

2001-09-28  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/pci.c (cyg_pci_find_next): 
	* include/pci.h: Allow platforms to restrict PCI bus/device ranges.

2001-08-22  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/pci.c: 
	printf() is no longer a part of RedBoot.  Thus all programs
	must use diag_printf() and related functions instead.

2001-02-28  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* tests/pci1.c (pci_scan): Added a new function to re-scan the
	device list after configuring to let a human confirm that we truly
	are seeing distinct devices - ie. do they retain their distinct
	resource allocations in the BARs?  This was useful to me in
	investigating a recalcitrant target...

2001-02-02  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/pci2.c (pci_test): Removed bogus check for 1MB IO limit.

2001-01-10  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

2000-12-21  Mark Salter  <msalter@redhat.com>

	* include/pci_hw.h: Add platform hook so certain devices
	can be skipped by generic PCI io code. This is a workaround
	for a hw problem where configuration space cycles on some
	devices cause a bus lockup.
	
	* src/pci.c (cyg_pci_find_next): Use platform hook to ignore
	certain devices during device search.

2000-12-02  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

2000-11-19  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/pci.c (cyg_pci_find_device): Don't update 'devid' if no
	suitable devices found.  This allows for simpler rescan for
	multiple device types.

2000-11-12  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/pci_hw.c: 
	* src/pci.c: Layout changes require <pkgconf/hal.h>

	combined with CYG_PCI_NULL_DEVFN.
	(cyg_pci_configure_device): Return true if device already configured.
	Fixed for devices which use no BARs.
	(cyg_pci_allocate_io_priv): Remove bogus limit check.
	(cyg_pci_configure_bus): New function to recursively configure a
	bus and its subordinate bases.

	* include/pci_cfg.h: Added bridge definitions.
	(CYG_PCI_CFG_BAR_5): Corrected.

	* include/pci.h (CYG_PCI_NULL_DEVFN): Define.
	(cyg_pci_device): Add bridge support. Add num_bars. Add
	declaration for cyg_pci_configure_bus.

2000-01-19  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/*.cdl: Add descriptions to a number of options &c which were
	lacking same, also tidied up other typos as noticed en passant.

1999-12-21  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/io_pci.cdl (CYGPKG_IO_PCI): Relevant to more than one platform

1999-09-10  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/pkgconf/io_pci.h: Reparent under CYGPKG_IO - this is used under
	more than one target now and the library itself is generic.
