><P
>The device driver for a USB slave device should supply one
<SPAN
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>usbs_control_endpoint</SPAN
> data structure per USB
device. This corresponds to endpoint 0 which will be used for all
control message interaction between the host and that device. The data
structure is also used for internal management purposes, for example
to keep track of the current state. In a typical USB peripheral there
will only be one such data structure in the entire system, but if
there are multiple USB slave ports, allowing the peripheral to be
connected to multiple hosts, then there will be a separate data
structure for each one. The name or names of the data structures are
determined by the device drivers. For example, the SA11x0 USB device
driver package provides <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>usbs_sa11x0_ep0</TT
>.</P
><P
>The operations on a control endpoint do not fit cleanly into a
conventional open/read/write I/O model. For example, when the host
sends a control message to the USB peripheral this may be one of four
types: standard, class, vendor and reserved. Some or all of the
standard control messages will be handled automatically by the common
USB slave package or by the device driver itself. Other standard
control messages and the other types of control messages may be
handled by a class-specific package or by application code. Although
it would be possible to have devtab entries such as
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/dev/usbs_ep0/standard</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/dev/usbs_ep0/class</TT
>, and then support read and
write operations on these devtab entries, this would add significant
overhead and code complexity. Instead, all of the fields in the
control endpoint data structure are public and can be manipulated
directly by higher level code if and when required. </P
><P
>Control endpoints involve a number of callback functions, with
higher-level code installing suitable function pointers in the control
endpoint data structure. For example, if the peripheral involves
vendor-specific control messages then a suitable handler for these
messages should be installed. Although the exact details depend on the
device driver, typically these callback functions will be invoked at
DSR level rather than thread level. Therefore, only certain eCos
functions can be invoked; specifically, those functions that are
guaranteed not to block. If a potentially blocking function such as a
semaphore wait or a mutex lock operation is invoked from inside the
callback then the resulting behaviour is undefined, and the system as
a whole may fail. In addition, if one of the callback functions
involves significant processing effort then this may adversely affect
the system's real time characteristics. The eCos kernel documentation
should be consulted for more details of DSR handling.</P

>It is the responsibility of higher-level code, usually the
application, to define the USB enumeration data. This needs to be
installed in the control endpoint data structure early on during
system startup, before the USB device is actually started and any
interaction with the host is possible. Details of the enumeration data
are supplied in the section <A
HREF="usbs-enum.html"
>USB Enumeration
Data</A
>. Typically, the enumeration data is constant for a given
peripheral, although it can be constructed dynamically if necessary.
However, the enumeration data cannot change while the peripheral is
connected to a host: the peripheral cannot easily claim to be a
keyboard one second and a printer the next.</P

than directly. It is provided by the device driver and should be
invoked once the system is fully initialized and interaction with the
host is possible. A typical implementation would change the USB data
pins from tristated to active. If the peripheral is already plugged
into a host then the latter should detect this change and start
interacting with the peripheral, including requesting the enumeration
data.</P

>The USB standard defines a number of states for a given USB
peripheral. The initial state is <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>detached</I
>, where
the peripheral is either not connected to a host at all or, from the
host's perspective, the peripheral has not started up yet because the
relevant pins are tristated. The peripheral then moves via
intermediate <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>attached</I
> and
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>powered</I
> states to its default or
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>reset</I
> state, at which point the host and
peripheral can actually start exchanging data. The first message is
from host to peripheral and provides a unique 7-bit address within the
local USB network, resulting in a state change to
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>addressed</I
>. The host then requests enumeration
data and performs other initialization. If everything succeeds the
host sends a standard set-configuration control message, after which
the peripheral is <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>configured</I
> and expected to be
up and running. Note that some USB device drivers may be unable to
distinguish between the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>detached</I
>,
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>attached</I
> and <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"

but generally this is not important to higher-level code.</P
><P
>A USB host should generate at least one token every millisecond. If a
peripheral fails to detect any USB traffic for a period of time then
typically this indicates that the host has entered a power-saving
mode, and the peripheral should do the same if possible. This
corresponds to the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>suspended</I
> bit. The actual
state is a combination of <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>suspended</I
> and the
previous state, for example <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>configured</I
> and
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>suspended</I
> rather than just
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>suspended</I
>. When the peripheral subsequently
detects USB traffic it would switch back to the
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>configured</I
> state.</P
><P
>The USB device driver and the common USB slave package will maintain
the current state in the control endpoint's
<TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
><I
>state</I
></TT
> field. There should be no need for
any other code to change this field, but it can be examined whenever
appropriate. In addition whenever a state change occurs the generic
code can invoke a state change callback function. By default, no such
callback function will be installed. Some class-specific packages such
as the USB-ethernet package will install a suitable function to keep
track of whether or not the host-peripheral connection is up, that is
whether or not ethernet packets can be exchanged. Application code can
also update this field. If multiple parties want to be informed of
state changes, for example both a class-specific package and
application code, then typically the application code will install its
state change handler after the class-specific package and is
responsible for chaining into the package's handler.</P
><P
>The state change callback function is invoked with four arguments. The
first identifies the control endpoint. The second is an arbitrary
pointer: higher-level code can fill in the
<TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
><I
>state_change_data</I
></TT
> field to set this. The
third argument specifies the state change that has occurred, and the
last argument supplies the previous state (the new state is readily
available from the control endpoint structure).</P
><P
>eCos does not provide any utility functions for updating or examining
the <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
><I
>state_change_fn</I

<TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
><I
>state_change_data</I

> fields. Instead, it is
expected that the fields in the

manipulated directly. Any utility functions would do just this, but
at the cost of increased code and cpu overheads.</P

consist of an initial eight-byte header, containing fields such as a

handled is described in the <A

><P
>If a standard control message cannot be handled by the device driver
itself, the driver checks the
<TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
><I
>standard_control_fn</I

> field in the control
endpoint data structure. If higher-level code has installed a suitable
callback function then this will be invoked with two argument, the
control endpoint data structure itself and the
<TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
><I
>standard_control_data</I
></TT
> field. The latter
allows the higher level code to associate arbitrary data with the
control endpoint. The callback function can return one of three
values: <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>HANDLED</I
> to indicate that the request has
been processed; <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>UNKNOWN</I
> if the message should be
handled by the default code; or <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>STALL</I
> to indicate
an error condition. If higher level code has not installed a callback
function or if the callback function has returned
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>UNKNOWN</I
> then the device driver will invoke a
default handler, <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>usbs_handle_standard_control</TT
>
provided by the common USB slave package.</P
><P
>The default handler can cope with all of the standard control messages
for a simple USB peripheral. However, if the peripheral involves
multiple configurations, multiple interfaces in a configuration, or
alternate settings for an interface, then this cannot be handled by
generic code. For example, a multimedia peripheral may support various
alternate settings for a given data source with different bandwidth
requirements, and the host can select a setting that takes into
account the current load. Clearly higher-level code needs to be aware
when the host changes the current setting, so that it can adjust the
rate at which data is fed to or retrieved from the host. Therefore the
higher-level code needs to install its own standard control callback
and process appropriate messages, rather than leaving these to the
default handler.</P
><P
>The default handler will take care of the
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>get-descriptor</I
> request used to obtain the
enumeration data. It has support for string descriptors but ignores
language encoding issues. If language encoding is important for the
peripheral then this will have to be handled by an
application-specific standard control handler.</P
><P
>The header file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>&lt;cyg/io/usb/usb.h&gt;</TT
> defines various
constants related to control messages, for example the function codes
corresponding to the standard request types. This header file is
provided by the common USB package, not by the USB slave package,
since the information is also relevant to USB hosts.</P

initial eight-byte header. The header indicates the direction of the
transfer, OUT for host to peripheral or IN for peripheral to host.

manipulate six fields within the control endpoint data structure to
ensure that the transfer happens correctly.</P

>For an OUT transfer, the handler should examine the length field in
the header and provide a single buffer for all the data. A

been transferred the completion callback will be invoked, and its
return value determines the response sent back to the host. The USB
standard allows for a new control message to be sent before the
current transfer has completed, effectively cancelling the current
operation. When this happens the completion function will also be
invoked. The second argument to the completion function specifies what
