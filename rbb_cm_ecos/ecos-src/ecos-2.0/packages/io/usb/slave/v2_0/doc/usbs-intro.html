>The eCos USB slave support allows developers to produce USB
peripherals. It consists of a number of different eCos packages:</P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>Device drivers for specific implementations of USB slave hardware, for
example the on-chip USB Device Controller provided by the Intel SA1110
processor. A typical USB peripheral will only provide one USB slave
port and therefore only one such device driver package will be needed.
Usually the device driver package will be loaded automatically when
you create an eCos configuration for target hardware that has a USB
slave device. If you select a target which does have a USB slave
device but no USB device driver is loaded, this implies that no such
device driver is currently available.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The common USB slave package. This serves two purposes. It defines the
API that specific device drivers should implement. It also provides
various utilities that will be needed by most USB device drivers and
applications, such as handlers for standard control messages.
Usually this package will be loaded automatically at the same time as
the USB device driver.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The common USB package. This merely provides some information common
to both the host and slave sides of USB, such as details of the
control protocol. It is also used to place the other USB-related
packages appropriately in the overall configuration hierarchy. Usually
this package will be loaded at the same time as the USB device driver.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Class-specific USB support packages. These make it easier to develop
specific classes of USB peripheral, such as a USB-ethernet device. If
no suitable package is available for a given class of peripheral then
the USB device driver can instead be accessed directly from
application code. Such packages will never be loaded automatically
since the configuration system has no way of knowing what class of USB
peripheral is being developed. Instead developers have to add the
appropriate package or packages explicitly.</P
></LI
></OL
><P
>These packages only provide support for developing USB peripherals,
not USB hosts.</P

including the <A

>. Only a brief summary is provided here.</P
><P
>A USB network is asymmetrical: it consists of a single host, one or
more slave devices, and possibly some number of intermediate hubs. The
host side is significantly more complicated than the slave side.
Essentially, all operations are initiated by the host. For example, if
the host needs to receive some data from a particular USB peripheral
then it will send an IN token to that peripheral; the latter should
respond with either a NAK or with appropriate data. Similarly, when
the host wants to transmit data to a peripheral it will send an OUT
token followed by the data; the peripheral will return a NAK if it is
currently unable to receive more data or if there was corruption,
otherwise it will return an ACK. All transfers are check-summed and
there is a clearly-defined error recovery process. USB peripherals can
only interact with the host, not with each other.</P
><P
>USB supports four different types of communication: control messages,
interrupt transfers, isochronous transfers, and bulk transfers.
Control messages are further subdivided into four categories:
standard, class, vendor and a reserved category. All USB peripherals
must respond to certain standard control messages, and usually this
will be handled by the common USB slave package (for complicated
peripherals, application support will be needed). Class and vendor
control messages may be handled by an class-specific USB support
package, for example the USB-ethernet package will handle control
messages such as getting the MAC address or enabling/disabling
promiscuous mode. Alternatively, some or all of these messages will
have to be handled by application code.</P
><P
>Interrupt transfers are used for devices which need to be polled
regularly. For example, a USB keyboard might be polled once every
millisecond. The host will not poll the device more frequently than
this, so interrupt transfers are best suited to peripherals that
involve a relatively small amount of data. Isochronous transfers are
intended for multimedia-related peripherals where typically a large
amount of video or audio data needs to be exchanged continuously.
Given appropriate host support a USB peripheral can reserve some of
the available bandwidth. Isochronous transfers are not reliable; if a
particular packet is corrupted then it will just be discarded and
software is expected to recover from this. Bulk transfers are used for
everything else: after taking care of any pending control, isochronous
and interrupt transfers the host will use whatever bandwidth remains
for bulk transfers. Bulk transfers are reliable.</P
><P
>Transfers are organized into USB packets, with the details depending
on the transfer type. Control messages always involve an initial
8-byte packet from host to peripheral, optionally followed by some
additional packets; in theory these additional packets can be up to 64
bytes, but hardware may limit it to 8 bytes. Interrupt transfers
involve a single packet of up to 64 bytes. Isochronous transfers
involve a single packet of up to 1024 bytes. Bulk transfers involve
multiple packets. There will be some number, possibly zero, of 64-byte
packets. The transfer is terminated by a single packet of less than 64
bytes. If the transfer involves an exact multiple of 64 bytes than the
final packet will be 0 bytes, consisting of just a header and checksum
which typically will be generated by the hardware. There is no
pre-defined limit on the size of a bulk transfer. Instead higher-level
protocols are expected to handle this, so for a USB-ethernet
peripheral the protocol could impose a limit of 1514 bytes of data
plus maybe some additional protocol overhead.</P
><P
>Transfers from the host to a peripheral are addressed not just to that
peripheral but to a specific endpoint within that peripheral.
Similarly, the host requests incoming data from a specific endpoint
rather than from the peripheral as a whole. For example, a combined
keyboard/touchpad device could provide the keyboard events on endpoint
1 and the mouse events on endpoint 2. A given USB peripheral can have
up to 16 endpoints for incoming data and another 16 for outgoing data.
However, given the comparatively high speed of USB I/O this endpoint
addressing is typically implemented in hardware rather than software,
and the hardware will only implement a small number of endpoints.
Endpoint 0 is generally used only for control messages.</P
><P
>In practice, many of these details are irrelevant to application code
or to class packages. Instead, such higher-level code usually just
performs blocking <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>read</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>write</TT
>, or non-blocking USB-specific calls, to
transfer data between host and target via a specific endpoint. Control
messages are more complicated but are usually handled by existing
code.</P
><P
>When a USB peripheral is plugged into the host there is an initial
enumeration and configuration process. The peripheral provides
information such as its class of device (audio, video, etc.), a
vendor id, which endpoints should be used for what kind of data, and
so on. The host OS uses this information to identify a suitable host
device driver. This could be a generic driver for a class of
peripherals, or it could be a vendor-specific driver. Assuming a
suitable driver is installed the host will then activate the USB
peripheral and perform additional application-specific initialisation.
For example for a USB-ethernet device this would involve obtaining an
ethernet MAC address. Most USB peripherals will be fairly simple, but
it is possible to build multifunction peripherals with multiple
configurations, interfaces, and alternate interface settings.</P
><P
>It is not possible for any of the eCos packages to generate all the
enumeration data automatically. Some of the required information such
as the vendor id cannot be supplied by generic packages; only by the
application developer. Class support code such as the USB-ethernet
package could in theory supply some of the information automatically,
but there are also hardware dependencies such as which endpoints get
used for incoming and outgoing ethernet frames. Instead it is the
responsibility of the application developer to provide all the
enumeration data and perform some additional initialisation. In
addition, the common USB slave package can handle all the standard
control messages for a simple USB peripheral, but for something like a
multifunction peripheral additional application support is needed.</P

>The initial implementation of the eCos USB slave packages involved
hardware that only supported control and bulk transfers, not
isochronous or interrupt. There may be future changes to the USB
code and API to allow for isochronous and interrupt transfers,
especially the former. Other changes may be required to support
different USB devices. At present there is no support for USB remote
wakeups, since again it is not supported by the hardware.</P

>eCos USB I/O Facilities</H2
><P
>For protocols other than control messages, eCos provides two ways of
performing USB I/O. The first involves device table or devtab entries such
as <A
HREF="usbs-devtab.html"
><TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/dev/usb1r</TT
></A
>,
with one entry per endpoint per USB device. It is possible to
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>open</TT
> these devices and use conventional blocking
I/O functions such as <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>read</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>write</TT
> to exchange data between host and
peripheral.</P
><P
>There is also a lower-level USB-specific API, consisting of functions
such as <A
HREF="usbs-start-rx.html"
><TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>usbs_start_rx_buffer</TT
></A
>.
A USB device driver will supply a data structure for each endpoint,
for example a <A
HREF="usbs-data.html"
><SPAN
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>usbs_rx_endpoint</SPAN
></A
>
structure for every receive endpoint. The first argument to
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>usbs_start_rx_buffer</TT
> should be a pointer to such
a data structure. The USB-specific API is non-blocking: the initial
call merely starts the transfer; some time later, once the transfer
has completed or has been aborted, the device driver will invoke a
completion function.</P
><P
>Control messages are different. With four different categories of
control messages including application and vendor specific ones, the
conventional
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>open</TT
>/<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>read</TT
>/<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>write</TT
>
model of I/O cannot easily be applied. Instead, a USB device driver
will supply a <A
HREF="usbs-control.html"
><SPAN
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>usbs_control_endpoint</SPAN
></A
>
data structure which can be manipulated appropriately. In practice the
standard control messages will usually be handled by the common USB
slave package, and other control messages will be handled by
class-specific code such as the USB-ethernet package. Typically,
application code remains responsible for supplying the <A
HREF="usbs-enum.html"
>enumeration data</A
> and for actually <A

>Enabling the USB code</H2
><P
>If the target hardware contains a USB slave device then the
appropriate USB device driver and the common packages will typically
be loaded into the configuration automatically when that target is
selected (assuming a suitable device driver exists). However, the
driver will not necessarily be active. For example a processor might
have an on-chip USB device, but not all applications using that
processor will want to use USB functionality. Hence by default the USB
device is disabled, ensuring that applications do not suffer any
memory or other penalties for functionality that is not required.</P
><P
>If the application developer explicitly adds a class support package
such as the USB-ethernet one then this implies that the USB device is
actually needed, and the device will be enabled automatically.
However, if no suitable class package is available and the USB device
will instead be accessed by application code, it is necessary to
enable the USB device manually. Usually the easiest way to do this is
to enable the configuration option
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYGGLO_IO_USB_SLAVE_APPLICATION</TT
>, and the USB device
driver and related packages will adjust accordingly. Alternatively,
the device driver may provide some configuration options to provide
more fine-grained control.</P
