>Description</H2
><P
>There is a USB standard for the protocol to be used between the host
and a class of communication devices, including ethernet. However, the
eCos USB-ethernet package does not implement this protocol: the target
hardware for which the package was first developed had certain
limitations, and could not implement the standard. Instead, the package
implements a simple new protocol.</P
><P
>A USB-ethernet peripheral involves bulk transfers on two endpoints:
one endpoint will be used for packets from host to peripheral and the
other will be used for the opposite direction. Transfers in both
directions are variable length, with a lower limit of 16 bytes and an
upper limit of 1516 bytes. The first two bytes of each transfer
constitute a header specific to USB-ethernet. The next 14 bytes form
the normal header for an ethernet frame: destination MAC address,
source MAC address, and a protocol field. The remaining data, up to
1500 bytes, are the payload. The first two bytes give the size of the
ethernet frame, least significant byte first, with a value between 14
and 1514.</P
><P
>For example an ARP request from host to peripheral involves an
ethernet frame of 42 bytes (0x002A), with the usual 14-byte header and
a 28-byte payload. The destination is the broadcast address
0xFFFFFFFFFFFF. The source depends on the MAC address specified for
the host in the call to <A
HREF="usbseth-init.html"
><TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>usbs_eth_init</TT
></A
>, e.g.
0x405D90A9BC02. The remaining data is as specified by the appropriate
<A
HREF="http://www.ietf.org"
TARGET="_top"
>IETF RFC's</A
>. The actual bulk
USB transfer involves the following sequence of 44 bytes:</P

appropriate.</P

The request field should be <TT

should specify a size of 6 bytes. The remaining fields of the control
message will be ignored by the USB-ethernet package. The response
consists of the 6-byte MAC address supplied by the initialization call

should be set to 0. The value field should be non-zero to enable
promiscuous mode, zero to disable it. The request field should be
<TT

>. The remaining fields in the control message
will be ignored. It is the responsibility of the host-side device
driver to keep track of whether or not promiscuous mode is currently
enabled. It will be disabled when the peripheral changes to
Configured state, typically at the point where the host-side device
driver has been activated.</P
