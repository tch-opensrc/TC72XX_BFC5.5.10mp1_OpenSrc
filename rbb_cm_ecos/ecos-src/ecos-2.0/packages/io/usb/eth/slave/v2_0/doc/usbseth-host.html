>Description</H2
><P
>The USB-ethernet package is supplied with a single host-side device
driver. This driver has been developed against the Linux kernel
2.2.16-22, as shipped with Red Hat 7. The driver is provided as is and
should not be considered production quality: for example it only
checks for a bogus vendor id <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>0x4242</TT
> rather than an
official vendor id supplied by the <A
HREF="http://www.usb.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>USB Implementers Forum</A
>. Also, if the
peripheral involves multiple configurations or multiple interfaces, it
will fail to detect this. However, the driver can be used for simple
testing and as the basis of a full device driver. Details of the
protocol used between host and peripheral can be found in the <A
HREF="usbseth-protocol.html"
>Communication Protocol</A
> section.</P
><P
>The host-side device driver can be found in the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>host</TT
> subdirectory of the USB-ethernet
package, specifically the file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ecos_usbeth.c</TT
>, and
comes with a <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Makefile</TT
>. Both files may need
to be modified for specific applications. For example, the vendor id
table <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ecos_usbeth_implementations</TT
> may need to be
updated for the specific USB peripheral being built. The
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Makefile</TT
> assumes that the Linux kernel sources
reside in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/src/linux</TT
>, and
that the kernel has already been configured and built. Assuming this
is the case, the device driver can be built simply by invoking
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make</B
> with no additional arguments. This will result
in a dynamically loadable kernel module,
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ecos_usbeth.o</TT
>, in the current directory.</P

>Note: </B
>As normal for Linux kernel builds, the generated files such as
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ecos_usbeth.o</TT
> live in the same directory as the
source tree. This is very different from eCos where the source tree
(or component repository) is kept separate from any builds. There may
be problems if the component repository is kept read-only or if it is
put under source code control. Any such problems can be avoided by
making a copy of the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>host</TT
>
subdirectory and building that copy.</P

>Loading the kernel module into the current system requires root
privileges. If the generic USB support is also a loadable module and
has not been loaded already, this must happen first:</P

the generic USB module will typically result in a number of messages
to the logfile <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/var/log/messages</TT
>, giving details
of the specific host-side hardware that has been detected plus any
hubs. The next step is to load the USB-ethernet module:</P

>If a suitable USB peripheral is now connected the host will detect
this, assign an address in the local USB network, obtain enumeration
data, and find a suitable device driver. Assuming the peripheral and
device driver agree on the supported vendor ids, the
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ecos_usbeth.o</TT

will be reported in the system log:</P

><P
>What can happen next depends very much on the software that is running
on top of the USB-ethernet package inside the peripheral. For example,
if there is a TCP/IP stack then it should be possible to bring up a
network connection between host and peripheral using
<B
