	* src/assabet_pcmcia.c (cf_hwr_change_state): Check for VERS_1
	field instead of MANID since some cards don't seem to have that one.
	Suggested by I-Jui Sung <ijsung@csie.nctu.edu.tw>.

2000-09-17  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/assabet_pcmcia.c: Change interrupt functions to have same
	calling convention as DSR.

2000-09-12  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/assabet_pcmcia.c: Fix build problem when built for eCos.

2000-08-28  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/assabet_pcmcia.c (cf_irq_dsr): Support [shared] network
	debug situation where "IF" functions need to see device interrupts.
	This is used to detect ^C over the connection.  This also requires
	additional care when setting up the bus initially.

2000-08-24  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/assabet_pcmcia.c: Add hardware function to clear interrupts.

2000-07-16  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/assabet_pcmcia.c: Remove dependency in generic I/O package.

2000-07-15  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/assabet_pcmcia.c: Support new slot-oriented interrupts.

2000-07-14  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/assabet_pcmcia.c: Support running in non-kernel (stand-alone)
	environments.
