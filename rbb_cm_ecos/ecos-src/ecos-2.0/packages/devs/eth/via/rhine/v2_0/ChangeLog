2002-06-14  Gary Thomas  <gary@chez-thomas.org>

	* src/if_rhine.c: 
	Need to include <pkgconf/io_eth_drivers.h> for proper configuration
	of stand-alone (polled) vs. system (interrupt driven) mode.

2001-08-22  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/via_rhine.h: 
	* src/if_rhine.c: 
	printf() is no longer a part of RedBoot.  Thus all programs
	must use diag_printf() and related functions instead.

2001-07-05  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/via_rhine.h: Define IMR init value.
	* src/if_rhine.c: And use it.
	
	* src/if_rhine.c: Remove unused code.
	* src/via_rhine.h: Remove unused variable.
	
	* src/if_rhine.c (find_rhine_match_func): Added debug output. Fix
	some warnings and an error.

2001-07-04  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/if_rhine.c: Added D-Link pre-reset magic. Disabled driver
	polls (leave it to interrupt handler).

	* src/via_rhine.h: Added more definitions.

	* src/if_rhine.c (rhine_can_send): Force MII status update by
	reading from PHY controller.

2001-07-02  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/via_rhine.h: Fail to build if CPU to PCI address translation
	macros are not provided.

2001-06-29  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/via_rhine.h: Fix macro typos.

	* src/if_rhine.c (rhine_poll): Put a mutex on this function.

2001-06-28  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/if_rhine.c: Comment out unused function to silence warning.
	Removed unused mem_base. Set interrupt priority to non-zero.
	
	* src/via_rhine.h (INCR_STAT): Fix typo.

2001-06-27  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/if_rhine.c (rhine_can_send): Read MII status which appears
	to make link magic work. Not at all clear why this is so, but it
	works.

	* src/via_rhine.h: Disable debug output.

	* src/if_rhine.c (rhine_start): Name magic registers.
	(rhine_start): Remove some verbose output.

	* src/via_rhine.h: Added register definitions. Removed unused key
	IDs.

2001-06-26  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/if_rhine.c: Rename PCI IO macros. 
	* src/via_rhine.h: Same. And include PCI header.

	* cdl/via_rhine_eth_drivers.cdl: Require PCI package.

2001-06-25  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/if_rhine.c: Some cleanups, more debug code added, use macros
	for accessing PCI IO space which platform can override. Some of
	these changes from David Woodhouse.
	* src/via_rhine.h: All macros moved to this file.

2001-06-07  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/via_rhine.h: Rename MII definitions.
	* src/if_rhine.c: Don't reset the controller when stopping. This
	fixes the problem with the link state being weird. Clean up the
	renegotiate code a bit.

	* src/if_rhine.c: Added code to gather statistics.
	Some output cleanup, sanity checking of RX queue only when
	assertions enabled.

2001-06-06  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/via_rhine.h: MII definitions.
	* src/if_rhine.c: Added MII accessor functions to allow a forced
	renegotiate of the connection on a link fail.

	* src/if_rhine.c: Use PCI information to configure devices. Mask
	interrupts in handlers.
	(rhine_dsr): Oops, skipped driver synchronization.

	* src/via_rhine.h: Added more private data.

	* cdl/via_rhine_eth_drivers.cdl: Removed static ESA config option
	- it belongs in the platform configury. Added device count for PCI
	configury.
	* src/if_rhine.c: Fix static ESA configury.
	* src/via_rhine.h: Changed private data accordingly.

	* src/if_rhine.c: Fix buglet in handling of small packets, small
	hacks to interrupt handling.

2001-06-01  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/if_rhine.c: Tell stack the ESA. Pad short packets.

	* src/via_rhine.h: Added defs.

	* src/if_rhine.c: Mask off PCI addresses - need proper macros for
	this, or rather, use PCI API to get correct addresses. Close RX/TX
	descriptor loops. Load RX/TX base pointers into NIC. Enable TX.

2001-05-31  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/via_rhine.h: Make TX/RX descriptor entries 32 bit only to
	avoid endian issues with offsets.

	* src/if_rhine.c: Hacking code to (more or less) comply to
	Rhine. Needs debugging though - manual is really thin!

2001-05-30  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* Cloned from AMD PCNet driver.
