	* src/if_i21143.c (MII_DELAY): Greatly reduce this, now it's
	working, so that we can poll for link status changes.  I don't see
	any other way to do this, since we would not necessarily be
	transmitting (to get a link fail code) when a person re-plugs the
	line.
	(i21143_status_changed): New function; a quicker test for
	negotiated line status changed.  Polled from the deliver routine.

	* src/if_i21143.c (i21143_ioctl): Implement SNMP statistics.
	(i21143_can_send): Enable the "unsticking" poll of tx and rx
	states; it seems not necessary, but it's also definitely not
	harmful.
	(generally): manage getting the link status better; it takes time
	so cache the answer.  Reset the system if it changed between
	_stop() and _start().

	* src/if_i21143.c (i21143_reset): Set the "store and forward" bit
	so that we can keep up with large transmits at 100Mbit.  Otherwise
	it underflows for packets of 700 bytes or so.

	* src/if_i21143.c: Got ESA filtering set up OK by using perfect
	filtering instead, with all the broadcast address except one with
	our true ESA.  Various changes to the debug printing too.

	* src/if_i21143.c (i21143_init): Read the good ESA (MAC address)
	from the serial EEPROM (or ROM) and use it if valid.

	* src/if_i21143.c: Duh.  Fix dangerously aliased local variable.
	Having a thing like int fred[0] on the stack tends to screw up
	other random variables.

	* cdl/intel_i21143_eth_drivers.cdl: New file.

	* src/if_i21143.c: New file.  Not working yet.
	Reception only occurs if "Receive All" CSR_OPMODE_RA is set.
	No transmission occurs to the wire though the machinery all works
	beautifully.
