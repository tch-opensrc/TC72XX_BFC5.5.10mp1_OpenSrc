 * File:
 *	$RCSfile: types.h,v $
 *	$Revision: 1.1.1.2 $
 *	$Date: 2002/03/14 17:54:24 $
 *
 * Purpose:
 *      This file defines basic types used in the ITU-T G.729A Speech
 *      codec.  These are defined here so that we may control
 *      how many bits of precision a type has on a particular
 *      platform.
 *
 * Operation:
 *	We define the following in this file:
 *
 *      typedef ... INT16
 *            This type definition defines the data type used for
 *            variables that must hold exactly 16 bits (signed).
 *
 *      typedef ... INT32
 *            This type definition defines the data type used for
 *            variables that must hold exactly 32 bits (signed).
 *
 * Notes/Issues:
 *      This file is correct for the following platforms (so far):
 *
 *            GNUWIN32 compiled with GCC
 *
 * $Log: types.h,v $
 * Revision 1.1.1.2  2002/03/14 17:54:24  pfine
 * Fixed CR/LF Problem

 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2002/03/13 18:20:24  pfine
 * DCS Ecos with Device Drivers
