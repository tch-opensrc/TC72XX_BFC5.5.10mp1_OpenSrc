Preliminary documentation for Cirrus Logic EDB72xx Ethernet driver
==================================================================

This driver has been tested on both the EDB7211 (EDB7111-2) and
EDB7209 boards.  

There is a problem with some EDB7209 boards which keeps the ethernet
chip from generating interrupts.  The following hardware change will
allow this (and thus the driver to work), but it precludes the
generation of interrupts when using the parallel port.

   Remove resistor R168
   Remove all jumpers from JP45

This problem is known to exist at least through EDB7209-2B.0.  It is
unknown [by the eCos team] if later revisions from Cirrus Logic have
fixed this problem.
