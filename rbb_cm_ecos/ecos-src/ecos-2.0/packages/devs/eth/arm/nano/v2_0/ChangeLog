	* include/devs_eth_nano.inl: Because we now arrange PCI window
	memory distant from normal RAM, it can be scattered in physical
	RAM.  So define CYGHWR_DEVS_ETH_INTEL_I82559_PCIMEM_DISCONTIGUOUS.
	This is not really needed by default with only 1Mb of PCI window,
	but the overhead is small.

	* cdl/nano_eth_drivers.cdl: New component defined here because
	it's platform dependent whether it's relevent, to control
	additional variables in RedBoot's flash config system.
	(CYGPKG_DEVS_ETH_I82559_ETH_REDBOOT_HOLDS_ESA): the new component.
	(CYGVAR_DEVS_ETH_I82559_ETH_REDBOOT_HOLDS_ESA_ETH0): and so on,
	control whether we create flash config variables here.
	
	* include/devs_eth_nano.inl: Define flash config variables, and
	macro to access them from the generic driver, called
	CYGHWR_DEVS_ETH_INTEL_I82559_GET_ESA(p_i82559,mac_address,ok).

	* cdl/nano_eth_drivers.cdl (CYGPKG_DEVS_ETH_ARM_NANO_ETH1):
	enabled by default; full demux ability now supported in generic
	device.

2001-03-12  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* cdl/nano_eth_drivers.cdl (CYGPKG_DEVS_ETH_ARM_NANO_ETH1):
	disabled by default.  The DEMUXing stuff for dealing with the fact
	that both devices are connected to GPIO0 is incomplete in the
	generic driver.

	* include/devs_eth_nano.inl: Add additional macros to get
	platform-required behaviour:
	(CYGHWR_DEVS_ETH_INTEL_I82559_MISSED_INTERRUPT): Poll for a missed
	interrupt by examining the level-attached GPIO lines.
	(CYGHWR_DEVS_ETH_INTEL_I82559_RESET_TIMEOUT):
	(CYGHWR_DEVS_ETH_INTEL_I82559_TIMEOUT_FIRED): Set and test timing
	compared to the ever-incrementing system OS timer *SA11X0_OSCR.
	(CYGPRI_DEVS_ETH_INTEL_I82559_MASK_INTERRUPTS): 
	(CYGPRI_DEVS_ETH_INTEL_I82559_UNMASK_INTERRUPTS): 
	(CYGPRI_DEVS_ETH_INTEL_I82559_ACK_INTERRUPTS): Rename local
	interrupt handing macros.

2001-03-01  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* include/devs_eth_nano.inl: New file.
	* cdl/nano_eth_drivers.cdl: New file.
	Platform specific information required to use the generic i82559
	driver for the BSE nanoEngine/nanoBridge SA1110 platform.
	This requires more configurability of the generic i82559
	introduced on the same date.
