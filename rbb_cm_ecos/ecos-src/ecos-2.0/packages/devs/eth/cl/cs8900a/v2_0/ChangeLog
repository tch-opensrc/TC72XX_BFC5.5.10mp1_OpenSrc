	* src/if_cs8900a.c: Interrupt stuff cleaned up. Fix device
	probing. Make driver fail when no ESA available and none has been
	configured. Compiler warning fixes and some printout cleanups.

	* src/if_cs8900a.c: Platform driver provides device
	information. Renamed functions and definitions. Init code changed
	some.

	* include/cs8900.h: Renaming some definitions.

	* cdl/cl_cs8900a_eth_drivers.cdl: Platform driver provides
