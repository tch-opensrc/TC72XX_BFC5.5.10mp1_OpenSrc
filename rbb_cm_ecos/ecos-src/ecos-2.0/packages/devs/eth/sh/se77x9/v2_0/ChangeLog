	* include/devs_eth_sh_se77x9.inl: Added buffer parameters.

2001-10-10  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/devs_eth_sh_se77x9.inl (CYGHWR_NS_DP83902A_PLF_RESET): 
	Change in calling convention - now uses soft "reset" address from
	device specific data.

2001-07-12  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/devs_eth_sh_se77x9.inl: Fix typo.

2001-06-16  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/devs_eth_sh_se77x9.inl: Use proper interrupt vector name.

2001-06-15  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/devs_eth_sh_se77x9.inl: Split in devs/config parts. Use
	proper delay in reset code.
	Removed unused delays. Tell driver DMA HW is broken (I suspect the
	FPGA - and yes, this took a very long time indeed to track down!).

	* cdl/sh_se77x9_eth_drivers.cdl: Removed ring size options. Force
	use of ESA until I figure out how to read the EPROM.

2001-06-14  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/sh_se77x9_eth_drivers.cdl: Made _SET_ESA option configurable.

	* include/devs_eth_sh_se77x9.inl: Added DATA I/O macros since the
	platform needs to be treated like it was BE when accessing the
	external devices.

2001-06-13  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/devs_eth_sh_se77x9.inl: Remove debug hack.

	* Created.
