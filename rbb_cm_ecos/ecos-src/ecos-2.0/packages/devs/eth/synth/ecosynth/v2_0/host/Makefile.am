AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS = 1.3 foreign

## Only some platforms are supported. Having the configure script throw
## an error when attempting to configure on an unsupported platform
## would be a mistake, since that would prevent any configury from
## the toplevel on unsupported platforms. Instead an automake conditional
## is used, leading to null makefiles on unsupported platforms.

## The synthetic target support consists of a single program rawether,
## a number of Tcl scripts, and some additional data files. These are
## all installed in a single directory $(libexec)/ecos/<package>_<version>/
## Neither the rawether executable nor any of the scripts are directly
## executable, instead rawether gets fork()'d/execve()'d by the Tcl
## script so $(libexec) is appropriate. Strictly speaking the
## Tcl scripts and data files are architecture-independent so should
## probably be installed in an analogous directory below $(datadir),
## but that would add more directories for little real gain. The scripts
## are treated as data files since they should not be executed directly,
## i.e. they should not be installed with the execute bit set.
