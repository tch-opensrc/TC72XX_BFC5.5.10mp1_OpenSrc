    description "
        The ethernet driver for the eCos synthetic target allows applications
        and other packages such as a TCP/IP stack to perform ethernet I/O.
        This can involve either an unused ethernet device, or an emulated
        ethernet device as provided by the Linux kernel's tunnel/tap
        support. The eCos code interacts with a suitable Linux application
        through the I/O auxiliary. Up to four ethernet devices are
        supported, and the host-side target definition file controls how
        each device will perform its I/O."
