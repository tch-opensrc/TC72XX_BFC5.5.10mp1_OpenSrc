	* cdl/ser_arm_pid.cdl: Remove irrelevant doc link.

2001-09-10  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

        * cdl/ser_arm_pid.cdl:        
        Fix 234000->230400 typo.

2000-09-18  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/pid_serial.h: [removed]
	* src/pid_serial_with_ints.c: [removed] Moved driver to generic
	16x5x package.
	* include/arm_arm7_pid_ser.inl: [added] Make use of generic
	driver.
	* cdl/ser_arm_pid.cdl: Matching changes.

	* ChangeLog: Cleaned out non-pid entries.

2000-08-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/pid_serial_with_ints.c (pid_serial_DSR): Remove accidental
	OVERRUNERR check duplication

2000-08-01  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/pid_serial_with_ints.c: Throughout, add support for line status
	and modem status callbacks, hardware RTS/CTS and DSR/DTR flow control
	(pid_serial_set_config): Now use keys to make
	more flexible.

	* src/pid_serial.h: Add more line status, interrupt status and modem
	status register definitions

	* cdl/ser_arm_pid.cdl: Implements flow control and line status
	interfaces

2000-06-22  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/<yournamehere>.cdl: Remove the comment on the empty
	include_files directive; the tools now support this correctly.
	This keeps internal include files internal.

2000-06-09  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/pid_serial_with_ints.c: 
	* src/pid_serial.h: 
	Cleaned up defines and made DSR handle all received characters.
	(Dave Airlie (airlied at parthus dot com))

2000-04-11  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/ser_arm_pid.cdl: Change the parent from CYGPKG_IO_SERIAL
	(which is enabled most of the time) to CYGPKG_IO_SERIAL_DEVICES
	(which is not...) thus allowing convenient control independent of
	platform.  Also enable all individual devices by default, now, so
	that they can be enabled simply by enabling the above new parent.

2000-04-07  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* ecos.db: Re-organize device packages.  This is a massive change
	involving deleting all the sources for serial and ethernet drivers
	from where they used to live in
	    packages/io/serial/current/src/ARCH/PLATFORM.[ch]
	    packages/net/drivers/eth/PLATFORM/current/src/...
	and reinstating them in
	    packages/devs/serial/ARCH/PLATFORM/current/src/...
	    packages/devs/eth/ARCH/PLATFORM/current/src/...

	All these new packages are properly defined in ecos.db, and are
	all of type "hardware" so that a "target" can grab them.
	
	This directory layout is descriptive of the devices we have right
	now, arch and platform are separate levels just to make it easier
	to navigate in the filesystem and similar to the HAL structure in
	the filesystem.

	It is *not* prescriptive of future work; for example, the mythical
	common highly-portable 16550 serial driver which works on many
	targets would be called "devs/serial/s16550/current", or a serial
	device for a particular board (cogent springs to mind) that can
	work with different CPUs fitted is "devs/serial/cogent/current".

	Changelogs have been preserved and replicated over all the new
	packages, so that no history is lost.

	The contents of individual source files are unchanged; they build
	in just the same emvironment except for a very few cases where the
	config file name changed in this movement.

	Targets in ecos.db have been redefined to bring in all relevant
	hardware packages including net and serial drivers (but the newly
	included packages are only active if their desired parent is
	available.)
	
	The names of CDL options (and their #defines of course) stay the
	same for the serial drivers, for backward compatibility.

	* templates/*/current.ect: these have had CYGPKG_IO_SERIAL added
	rather than it being in (almost) all target definitions.
