	* cdl/ser_arm_integrator.cdl: Remove irrelevant doc link.

	* cdl/ser_arm_integrator.cdl:
	Disable testing of 57600 and 115200 baud rates. The CPUs we are
	currently using (ARM7TDMI and ARM966E) have no cache and are too
	slow to handle the higher baud rates in the FIFO-free UARTs we
	have. In the future we may need to revisit this an make it
	conditional on the CPU available.

	* New package for ARM Integrator serial driver derived from
	ARM PID serial driver.
