2003-02-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/ser_sh_sci.cdl: Remove irrelevant doc link.

2002-05-08  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/sh_sci_serial.c: Register renaming.

2002-04-23  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/sh_sci_serial.c: Compute register offsets from register
	definitions. Don't define SCI base.

2001-02-26  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/sh_sci_serial.c (sh_serial_er_DSR): Enable interrupts on
	exit.

2000-09-26  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/ser_sh_sci.cdl: Minor hack to allow both SCI and SCIF
	packages to be used at the same time.
	* src/sh_sci_serial.c: Same.

2000-09-05  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/sh_sci_serial.c: Moved to generic SH SCI package.
	* ChangeLog: Removed all non-SCI related references.
	
2000-08-01  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/sh_sci_serial.c (sh_serial_set_config): Now use keys to make
	more flexible.

2000-06-22  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/<yournamehere>.cdl: Remove the comment on the empty
	include_files directive; the tools now support this correctly.
	This keeps internal include files internal.

2000-04-11  Hugo Tyson	<hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/ser_sh_edk7708.cdl: Change the parent from CYGPKG_IO_SERIAL
	(which is enabled most of the time) to CYGPKG_IO_SERIAL_DEVICES
	(which is not...) thus allowing convenient control independent of
	platform.  Also enable all individual devices by default, now, so
	that they can be enabled simply by enabling the above new parent.

2000-04-11  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/ser_sh_edk7708.cdl: Move compile statement into a
	sub-component.

2000-04-07  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* ecos.db: Re-organize device packages.  This is a massive change
	involving deleting all the sources for serial and ethernet drivers
	from where they used to live in
	    packages/io/serial/current/src/ARCH/PLATFORM.[ch]
	    packages/net/drivers/eth/PLATFORM/current/src/...
	and reinstating them in
	    packages/devs/serial/ARCH/PLATFORM/current/src/...
	    packages/devs/eth/ARCH/PLATFORM/current/src/...

	All these new packages are properly defined in ecos.db, and are
	all of type "hardware" so that a "target" can grab them.
	
	This directory layout is descriptive of the devices we have right
	now, arch and platform are separate levels just to make it easier
	to navigate in the filesystem and similar to the HAL structure in
	the filesystem.

	It is *not* prescriptive of future work; for example, the mythical
	common highly-portable 16550 serial driver which works on many
	targets would be called "devs/serial/s16550/current", or a serial
	device for a particular board (cogent springs to mind) that can
	work with different CPUs fitted is "devs/serial/cogent/current".

	Changelogs have been preserved and replicated over all the new
	packages, so that no history is lost.

	The contents of individual source files are unchanged; they build
	in just the same emvironment except for a very few cases where the
	config file name changed in this movement.

	Targets in ecos.db have been redefined to bring in all relevant
	hardware packages including net and serial drivers (but the newly
	included packages are only active if their desired parent is
	available.)
	
	The names of CDL options (and their #defines of course) stay the
	same for the serial drivers, for backward compatibility.

	* templates/*/current.ect: these have had CYGPKG_IO_SERIAL added
	rather than it being in (almost) all target definitions.
	
2000-03-31  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/ser_sh_edk7708.cdl: Limit legal baud rate range.
	* src/sh/sh_sci_serial.c: Use baud rate macro instead of hardwired
	constants.

2000-02-11  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/sh/sh_sci_7708.inl (DEVTAB_ENTRY): 
	serial_devio => cyg_io_serial_devio

1999-06-16  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/sh/sh_serial.c:          [removed]
	* src/sh/sh_sci_serial.c:      [added]
	* src/sh/sh_sci_7708.inl:      [added]
	Renamed CDL options and restructered driver.
	Fixed CDL typo.
	
1999-05-31  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/sh/sh_serial.c: Fixed receive interrupts and added handler for
	error interrupts.

1999-05-26  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/sh/sh_serial.c: Added more baud rate values. Disabled
	interrupt driven receive. Fixed config_port to enable proper
	interrupt flags.

1999-05-24  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/PKGconf.mak:
	* include/pkgconf/io_serial.h: 
	* src/sh/sh_serial.c: 
	Added sh driver.
