2003-02-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/ser_sh_scif.cdl: Remove irrelevant doc link.

2002-05-08  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/sh_scif_serial.c: Added SH2 support. Added break interrupt
	support. Added IrDA support. Added async RX/TX support. Added
	support for platforms to add config keys and handle flow
	control. Register renaming.

	* cdl/ser_sh_scif.cdl: Added async RX/TX and IRDA support. Also
	added interface for support of break interrupts.

2002-01-30  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/sh_scif_serial.c (sh3_scif_tx_DSR): Stop single-character
	transmit if transmitter gets disabled. This does not change the
	(output) semantics of the code, but does prevent it from looping
	over the full size of the FIFO calling the (inactive) xmt_char
	callback.

2001-02-27  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/sh_scif_serial.c (sh3_scif_er_DSR): Clear break flag.

2001-02-26  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/sh_scif_serial.c (sh3_scif_er_DSR): Enable interrupts on
	exit. Clear ER flag.

2000-10-23  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/sh_scif_serial.c: Include cyg_ass.h

2000-10-12  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/sh_scif_serial.c (sh3_scif_set_config): Changes to the flow
	control handling. Renamed DMA variables.

2000-10-12  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/sh_scif_serial.c: return -EINVAL when unsupported flow control
	mode requested.

2000-10-06  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/sh_scif_serial.c: Change to new block call syntax.
	Clean up start_xmit code. Do block transfers in serial DSRs.

2000-10-03  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/sh_scif_serial.c: Fixed receive FIFO problem. Added Line
	Status handling. Don't enable TX interrupts in initialization.
	* src/sh_scif_serial.c: Added DMA support. Added RTS/CTS control.
	* cdl/ser_sh_scif.cdl: Added DMA interface.

2000-09-26  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/ser_sh_scif.cdl: Minor hack to allow both SCI and SCIF
	packages to be used at the same time.
	* src/sh_scif_serial.c: Same.

2000-09-25  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/sh_scif_serial.c: Use the SCI macros for baud rate
	calculation.

2000-09-05  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/sh_scif_serial.c: Moved to separate SCIF package.
	* ChangeLog: Cleaned out all non-SCIF related entries.

2000-08-01  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/sh3_scif_serial.c (sh3_scif_set_config): Now use keys to make
	more flexible.

2000-06-22  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/<yournamehere>.cdl: Remove the comment on the empty
	include_files directive; the tools now support this correctly.
	This keeps internal include files internal.

2000-04-11  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/ser_sh_scif.cdl: Change the parent from CYGPKG_IO_SERIAL
	(which is enabled most of the time) to CYGPKG_IO_SERIAL_DEVICES
	(which is not...) thus allowing convenient control independent of
	platform.  Also enable all individual devices by default, now, so
	that they can be enabled simply by enabling the above new parent.

2000-04-11  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/sh3_scif_serial.c: Can't get input FIFO to work properly.
	Disabled for now.

2000-04-07  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* ecos.db: Re-organize device packages.  This is a massive change
	involving deleting all the sources for serial and ethernet drivers
	from where they used to live in
	    packages/io/serial/current/src/ARCH/PLATFORM.[ch]
	    packages/net/drivers/eth/PLATFORM/current/src/...
	and reinstating them in
	    packages/devs/serial/ARCH/PLATFORM/current/src/...
	    packages/devs/eth/ARCH/PLATFORM/current/src/...

	All these new packages are properly defined in ecos.db, and are
	all of type "hardware" so that a "target" can grab them.
	
	This directory layout is descriptive of the devices we have right
	now, arch and platform are separate levels just to make it easier
	to navigate in the filesystem and similar to the HAL structure in
	the filesystem.

	It is *not* prescriptive of future work; for example, the mythical
	common highly-portable 16550 serial driver which works on many
	targets would be called "devs/serial/s16550/current", or a serial
	device for a particular board (cogent springs to mind) that can
	work with different CPUs fitted is "devs/serial/cogent/current".

	Changelogs have been preserved and replicated over all the new
	packages, so that no history is lost.

	The contents of individual source files are unchanged; they build
	in just the same emvironment except for a very few cases where the
	config file name changed in this movement.

	Targets in ecos.db have been redefined to bring in all relevant
	hardware packages including net and serial drivers (but the newly
	included packages are only active if their desired parent is
	available.)
	
	The names of CDL options (and their #defines of course) stay the
	same for the serial drivers, for backward compatibility.

	* templates/*/current.ect: these have had CYGPKG_IO_SERIAL added
	rather than it being in (almost) all target definitions.
	
2000-04-10  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/sh/sh3_scif_serial.c: 
	Working, but FIFO isn't enabled due to an interrupt problem.

2000-04-04  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/sh/sh3_scif_serial.c: FIFO related changes.

2000-04-03  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/ser_sh_scif.cdl: 
	* src/sh/sh_scif_serial.c:
	Added SCIF driver, based on SCI driver.
