>The NEC uPD985xx family of processors is supplied with an on-chip USB
slave device, the UDC (USB Device Controller). This supports seven
endpoints. Endpoint 0 can only be used for control messages. Endpoints
1 and 2 are for isochronous transmits and receives respectively.
Endpoints 3 and 4 support bulk transmits and receives. Endpoints 5 and
6 normally support interrupt transmits and receives,but endpoint 5 can
also be configured to support bulk transmits. At this time only the
control endpoint 0, the bulk endpoints 3 and 4, and the interrupt
endpoint 5 are supported.</P

>Endpoint Data Structures</H2
><P
>The uPD985xx USB device driver can provide up to four data structures
corresponding to the four supported endpoints: a
<SPAN
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>usbs_control_endpoint</SPAN
> structure
<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>usbs_upd985xx_ep0</TT
>;
<SPAN
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>usbs_tx_endpoint</SPAN
> structures
<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>usbs_upd985xx_ep3</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>usbs_upd985xx_ep5</TT
>; and a
<SPAN
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>usbs_rx_endpoint</SPAN
>
<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>usbs_upd985xx_ep4</TT
>. The header file
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>cyg/io/usb/usbs_nec_upd985xx.h</TT
>
provides declarations for these.</P
><P
>Not all applications will require support for all the endpoints. For
example, if the intended use of the UDC only involves peripheral to
host transfers then <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>usbs_upd985xx_ep4</TT
> is redundant.
The device driver provides configuration options to control the
presence of each endpoint:</P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>Endpoint 0 is controlled by
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYGFUN_DEVS_USB_UPD985XX_EP0</TT
>. This defaults to
enabled if there are any higher-level packages that require USB
hardware or if the global preference
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYGGLO_IO_USB_SLAVE_APPLICATION</TT
> is enabled,
otherwise it is disabled. Usually this has the desired effect. It may
be necessary to override this in special circumstances, for example if
the target board uses an external USB chip in preference to the UDC
and it is that external chip's device driver that should be used
rather than the on-chip UDC. It is not possible to disable endpoint 0
and at the same time enable one or both of the other endpoints, since
a USB device is only usable if it can process the standard control
messages.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Endpoint 3 is controlled by
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYGPKG_DEVS_USB_UPD985XX_EP3</TT
>. By default this
endpoint is disabled: according to NEC erratum U3 there may be
problems when attempting bulk transfers of 192 bytes or greater. As an
alternative the device driver provides endpoint 5 configured to
support bulk transfers. Endpoint 3 can be enabled if the application
only requires bulk transfers of less than 192 bytes, or if this
erratum is not applicable to the system being developed for other
reasons.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Similarly endpoint 4 is controlled by
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYGPKG_DEVS_USB_UPD985XX_EP4</TT
>. This is enabled by
default whenever endpoint 0 is enabled, but it can be disabled
manually.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Endpoint 5 is controlled by
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYGPKG_DEVS_USB_UPD985XX_EP5</TT
>. This is enabled by
default whenever endpoint 0 is enabled, but it can be disabled
manually. There is also a configuration option
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYGIMP_DEVS_USB_UPD985XX_EP5_BULK</TT
>, enabled by
default. This option allows the endpoint to be used for bulk
transfers rather than interrupt transfers.</P
></LI
></OL
><P
>The uPD985xx USB device driver implements the interface specified by the
common eCos USB Slave Support package. The documentation for that
package should be consulted for further details. </P
><P
>The device driver assumes a bulk packet size of 64 bytes, so this
value should be used in the endpoint descriptors in the enumeration
data provided by application code. The device driver also assumes
a control packet size of eight bytes, and again this should be
reflected in the enumeration data. If endpoint 5 is configured for
interrupt rather than bulk transfers then the maximum packet size is
limited to 64 bytes by the USB standard.</P

>Devtab Entries</H2
><P
>In addition to the endpoint data structures the uPD985xx USB device
driver can also provide devtab entries for each endpoint. This allows
higher-level code to use traditional I/O operations such as
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>open</TT
>/<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>read</TT
>/<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>write</TT
>
rather than the USB-specific non-blocking functions like
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>usbs_start_rx_buffer</TT
>. These devtab entries are
optional since they are not always required. The relevant
configuration options are
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYGVAR_DEVS_USB_UPD985XX_EP0_DEVTAB_ENTRY</TT
>,
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYGVAR_DEVS_USB_UPD985XX_EP3_DEVTAB_ENTRY</TT
>,
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYGVAR_DEVS_USB_UPD985XX_EP4_DEVTAB_ENTRY</TT
>, and
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYGVAR_DEVS_USB_UPD985XX_EP5_DEVTAB_ENTRY</TT
>. By
default these devtab entries are provided if the global preference
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYGGLO_USB_SLAVE_PROVIDE_DEVTAB_ENTRIES</TT
> is enabled,
which is usually the case. Obviously a devtab entry for a given
endpoint will only be provided if the underlying endpoint is enabled.
For example, there will not be a devtab entry for endpoint 4 if
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYGPKG_DEVS_USB_UPD985XX_EP4</TT
> is disabled.</P
><P
>The names for the devtab entries are determined by using a
configurable base name and appending <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>0c</TT
>,
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>3w</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>4r</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>5w</TT
>.
The base name is determined by the configuration option
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYGDAT_DEVS_USB_UPD985XX_DEVTAB_BASENAME</TT
> and has a
default value of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/dev/usbs</TT
>, so the devtab entry for
endpoint 4 would default to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>/dev/usbs4r</TT
>. If the
target hardware involves multiple USB devices then application
developers may have to change the base name to prevent a name clash
with other USB device drivers.</P

><H2
>Restrictions</H2
><P
>The current device driver imposes a restriction on certain bulk
receives on endpoint 4. If the protocol being used involves
variable-length transfers, in other words if the host is allowed to
send less data than a maximum-sized transfer, then the buffer passed
to the device driver for receives must be aligned to a 16-byte
cacheline boundary and it must be a multiple of this 16-byte cacheline
size. This restriction does not apply if the protocol only involves
fixed-size transfers.</P

><DIV
CLASS="REFSECT1"
><A
NAME="AEN64"
></A
><H2
>Optional Hardware Workarounds</H2
><P
>The NEC errata list a number of other problems that affect the
USB device driver. The device driver contains workarounds for these,
which are enabled by default but can be disabled if the application
developer knows that the relevant errata are not relevant to the
system being developed.</P
><P
>Erratum S1 lists a possible problem if the device driver attempts
multiple writes to the USB hardware. This is circumvented by a
dummy read operation after every write. If this workaround is not
required then the configuration option
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYGIMP_DEVS_USB_UPD985XX_IBUS_WRITE_LIMIT</TT
> can be disabled.</P
><P
>Errata U3 and U4 describe various problems related to concurrent
transmissions on different endpoints. By default the device driver
works around this by serializing all transmit operations. For example
if the device driver needs to send a response to a control message on
endpoint 0 while there is an ongoing bulk transfer on endpoint 5, the
response is delayed until the bulk transfer has completed. Under
typical operating conditions this does not cause any problems:
endpoint 0 traffic usually happens only during initialization, when
the target is connected to the host, while endpoint 5 traffic only
happens after initialization. However if transmit serialization is
inappropriate for the system being developed then it can be disabled
using the configuration option
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CYGIMP_DEVS_USB_UPD985XX_SERIALIZE_TRANSMITS</TT
>. </P
></DIV
><DIV
CLASS="REFSECT1"
><A
NAME="AEN71"
></A
><H2
>Platform Dependencies</H2
><P
>On some platforms it is necessary for the low-level USB device driver
to perform some additional operations during start-up. For example it
may be necessary to manipulate one of the processor's GPIO lines
before the host can detect a new USB peripheral and attempt to
communicate with it. This avoids problems if the target involves a
significant amount of work prior to device driver initialization, for
example a power-on self-test sequence. If the USB host attempted to
contact the target before the USB device driver had been initialized,
it would fail to get the expected responses and conclude that the
target was not a functional USB peripheral.</P
><P
>Platform-specific initialization code can be provided via a macro
<TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>UPD985XX_USB_PLATFORM_INIT</TT
>. Typically this macro
would be defined in the platform HAL's header file
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>cyg/hal/plf_io.h</TT
>. If the
current platform defines such a macro, the USB device driver will
invoke it during the endpoint 0 start-up operation.</P
