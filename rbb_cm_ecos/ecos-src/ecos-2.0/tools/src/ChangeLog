	* Makefile.in: Regenerate after acinclude.m4 update

2002-08-03  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* acinclude.m4, configure.in, Makefile.am:
	Rework host-side autoconf support

2001-10-15  Julian Smart <julians@redhat.com>

    * Mounts /ecos-x now, not /x
    * Fixed invocation of 'mount' when about to build

2001-07-26  Julian Smart <julians@redhat.com>

    * Only use Registry functions if building a GUI Configtool.
    * ecosconfig.exe doesn't now get built when building the GUI
      Configtool.

2001-07-09  Julian Smart <julians@redhat.com>

    * Fixed (I hope) a long-term bug in both versions of the Configtool,
    whereby conflicts involving bool-data values weren't
    resolved.

2001-06-18  Julian Smart <julians@redhat.com>

    * Added possible fix for Tcl crash bug under Windows 9x, by
    using the wxWindows Mkdir function instead of Tcl's mkdir.

2001-06-04  Julian Smart <julians@redhat.com>

    * Changed cygpath in build.cxx to use /cygdrive notation,
    checking in the registry first in case the user has customized
    the /cygdrive mount point.

2001-05-23  Julian Smart <julians@redhat.com>

    * Added Srdjan Sobajic's most excellent host/README improvements,
    and listed the directories more clearly with a brief reference
    to the new Configtool and its own readme.

2001-05-16  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* acinclude.m4 :
	Update compiler flag handling with g++ to use -O0 rather than
	-O2. The extra run-time performance is not worth the build
	overheads. Also sort out the Tcl macro for VC++ builds.

	* configure.in : clean up some old cruft

	aclocal.m4, configure, Makefile.in: regenerate

2001-01-29  Andreas Schuldei  <andreas@schuldei.org>

	* acinclude.m4 (CYG_AC_PATH_TCL): Simplify Tcl installation searching

2000-10-23  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* configure: Disable ser_filter magic for now - properly this time!
	* configure.in: Ditto.

2000-10-17  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* configure: Disable ser_filter magic for now.
	* configure.in: Ditto.

2000-09-15  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* Makefile.in: Added ser_filter rules.
	* configure: Ditto.
	* configure.in: Ditto.

2000-09-12  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* README
	Clarify which configure script should be used.

2000-08-18  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* configure.in:
	Allow cross-compilation

	* Makefile.in, configure:
	Regenerate

2000-03-13  John Dallway  <jld@cygnus.co.uk>

	* README:
	Mention use of the short form of the path to the configure
	script under Windows.

2000-03-12  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* acinclude.m4, and lots of other files:
	Change the CYG_AC_PATH_TCL macro to use tclConfig.sh, make
	appropriate adjustments elsewhere. Also, add dependencies
	such that the commands now depend on the libraries.

2000-03-08  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* README:
	Updated.

	* configure.in (ECOS_DIRS):
	Use the infrastructure and Tcl macros at the toplevel, so that
	configure --help gives the right information.
	
	* configure.in (ECOS_DIRS):
	Look for the file tools/ecostest/common/configure, rather than
	just the directory.

2000-03-01  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* Create toplevel ChangeLog for the eCos host-side.
