To-Do List for Configuration Tool 2.x
=====================================

- Implement Memory Layout Tool.

- Verify Run Tests Dialog works for TCP/IP mode on Linux.
  There's a problem under Windows too, apparently (2002-02-13),
  whereby everything is greyed out.

- Importing more than one package at a time can cause conflicts
  whereas importing one at a time causes no conflicts.

- Switching to Rich Edit control for Output Window causes scroll problems
  on Windows 98.

- Resolve target makefile problems. A user:-

  "It looks like the Configuration Tool 2.0 builds the library by replacing
  lib members, not recreating the whole library. Example situation: I want to
  remove POSIX pthread support and write my enhanced pthread_create() etc..
  If I just uncheck POSIX thread support and rebuild, the pthread functions
  remain in libtarget.a, resulting to redefinition error in my application
  link phase. Is this intended for some obvious reason?
  Now I must save to another xxx.ecc and build all."

  Bart says: "The whole makefile generation system needs a major overhaul."

- Make as many UI elements as possible copyable to the clipboard, such as the
  name and description for a configuration option. Can do this via the right-click
  menus.

- Should look for a .ecc file in the current directory if no save file is
  passed on the command line.

- Packages dialog:

  o optionally, the ability to hide inactive and/or calculated options
    and/or interfaces. They add a lot to visual clutter, but we do require the
    user to be _able_ to view them if need be.

- List controls: sometimes it's not possible to scroll horizontally to see
  all of a label, for example in the Properties window. Need to set the
  column width according to the maximum size of labels in that column.
